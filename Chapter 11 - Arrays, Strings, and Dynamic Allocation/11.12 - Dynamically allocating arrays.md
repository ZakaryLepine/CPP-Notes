C++ allows dynamically allocating arrays of variables.

Dynamically allocated arrays can choose their length at runtime.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    int length{};
    std::cin >> length;

    int* array{ new int[length]{} }; // use array new.  Note that length does not need to be constant!

    std::cout << "I just allocated an array of integers of length " << length << '\n';

    array[0] = 5; // set element 0 to value 5

    delete[] array; // use array delete to deallocate array

    // we don't need to set array to nullptr/0 here because it's going out of scope immediately after this anyway

    return 0;
}
```

The length of the dynamically allocated array must be a type that converts to *std::size_t*. 

## Dynamically deleting arrays
Use the array version of the delete operator (delete[]).

Tells the CPU to clean up multiple variables.


## Dynamic arrays are almost identical to fixed arrays
Dynamic arrays begin as pointers to the first element of their arrays.

A dynamic array does not know its length.

A dynamic array behaves identically to a decayed fixed array.

## Initializing dynamically allocated arrays
```cpp
int* array{ new int[length]{} }; //Zero-initialization
```

```cpp
int fixedArray[5] = { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // initialize a fixed array before C++11
int* array{ new int[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 } }; // initialize a dynamic array since C++11
// To prevent writing the type twice, we can use auto. This is often done for types with long names.
auto* array{ new int[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 } };
```

## Resizing arrays
C++ does not provide a way to resize a dynamic array that has already been allocated. 

A new dynamic array must be allocated.

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
Write a program that:

-   Asks the user how many names they wish to enter.
-   Dynamically allocates a `std::string` array.
-   Asks the user to enter each name.
-   Calls `std::sort` to sort the names.
-   Prints the sorted list of names.

`std::string` supports comparing strings via the comparison operators < and >. You donâ€™t need to implement string comparison by hand.

Your output should match this:
```
How many names would you like to enter? 5
Enter name #1: Jason
Enter name #2: Mark
Enter name #3: Alex
Enter name #4: Chris
Enter name #5: John

Here is your sorted list:
Name #1: Alex
Name #2: Chris
Name #3: Jason
Name #4: John
Name #5: Mark
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "How many names would you like to enter?";
	int numberOfNames { 0 };
	std::cin >> numberOfNames;

	int* nameArray { new int[numberOfNames]{} };
	for (int index {0}; index < numberOfNames; ++index)
	{
		std::cout << "Enter name #" << index << ":";

        std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, nameArray[index]);
	}

	std::sort(nameArray, nameArray + numberOfNames);

	std::cout << "\n";
	
	std::cout << "Here is the sorted list:\n";

	for (int index {0}; index < numberOfNames; ++index)
	{
		std::cout << "Name #" << index + 1 << ": " << nameArray[index] << "\n";
	}

	delete[] nameArray;
	
	nameArray = nullptr;
	
	return 0;
}
```
