Certain operators require their operations be of the same type. If one of these operators are invoked with operands of different types, one or both of the operands will be implicitly converted to matching types. 

## The operators that require operands of the same type
- Binary arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, %
- Binary relation operators: <, >, <=, >=, \==, !=
- Binary bitwise arithmetic operators: &, ^, |
- Conditional operator ?: 

## The usual arithmetic conversion rules
Compiler has a prioritzed list of types:
-   long double (highest)
-   double.
-   float.
-   unsigned long long.
-   long long.
-   unsigned long.
-   long.
-   unsigned int.
-   int (lowest).

There are two rule:
- If the type of at least one of the operands is on the priority list, the operand with lower priority is converted to the type of the operand with higher priority.
- Otherwise both operands are numerically promoted.
