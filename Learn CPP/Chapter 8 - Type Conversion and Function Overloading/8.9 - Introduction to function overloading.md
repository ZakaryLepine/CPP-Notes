## Introduction to function overloading
**Function Overloading:** Creating multiple functions with the same identifier. Function overloading works as long as each identically named function has different parameter types (functions can be differentiated).

**Overloaded Function:** Function sharing a name with other functions in the same scope.

## Introduction to overload resolution
**Overload Resolution:** When an overloaded function is called, the compiler attempts to match the function call to the appropriate overload based on arguments in the function call.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

double add(double x, double y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << add(1, 2); // calls add(int, int)
    std::cout << '\n';
    std::cout << add(1.2, 3.4); // calls add(double, double)

    return 0;
}
```

## What is necessary for overloaded functions to compile
Two things must be true to allow a program with overloaded functions to compile:
1. Each overloaded function has to be differentiated from the others.
2. Each call to an overloaded function has to resolve to an overloaded function.

If either of these conditions are not met, a compile error will occur
