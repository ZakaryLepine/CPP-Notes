## Introduction to C++ templates
The template system was designed to simplify the process of creating functions (or classes) that are able to work with different data types.

**Template:** Describes what a function/class looks like.

**Placeholder Type (Template Type):** Represents a type that is not known at the time the template is written but which the type is provided later.

A template can use one or more placeholder types.

Once a template is defined, the compiler can use the template to generate as many overloaded functions as necessary.

## Function templates
**Function Template:** Function-like definition used to generate one or more overloaded functions where each overload has a different set of actual types. 

**Template Parameter Declarations:** Tells the compiler that the function is a function template and that a name is used as a template type.

Each template function has its own template parameter declaration.

```cpp
template <typename T> // this is the template parameter declaration
T max(T x, T y) // this is the function template definition for max<T>
{
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}
```
