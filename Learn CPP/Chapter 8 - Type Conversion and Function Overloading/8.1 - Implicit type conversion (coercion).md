## Introduction to type conversion
**Type Conversion:** Process of converting a value from one data type to another data type.

Type conversion can be invoked implicilty (as needed by the compiler) or explicitly (when request by the user).

## Implicit Type Conversion
**Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic Type Conversion/Coercion):** Type conversion performed automatically by the compiler when a data type is required but a different data type is supplied. 

## What happens when a type conversion is invoked
When a type conversion is invoked (explicitly or implicitly), the compuiler will determine whether it can convert the value from the current type to the desired type. 

If a valid conversion is found, the compiler produces a new value of the desired type. 

If a valid conversion is not found, the compilation will fail with a compile error. 

## The standard conversion
C++ language standard defines how different fundamental types can be converted to other types. 

The standard conversions can be divided into four categories:
1. Numeric promotions
2. Numeric conversions
3. Arithmetic conversions
4. Other conversions
