## Numeric promotion
**Numeric Promotion:** Type conversion of a narrower numeric type to a wider numeric type. 

**Value-Preserving:** All values in the original type are representable without loss of data or precision in the new type.

All numeric promotions are value-preserving.

## Floating point numeric promotion
**Floating point promotion:** Rules that allow a smaller floating-point type to be converted to a larger floating-point type.

## Integral numeric promotion
**Integral promotion:** Rules that allow a smaller integral type to be converted to a larger integral type.

The following conversions can be made:
- signed *char* or signed *short* can be converted to *int*.
- unsigned *char*, *char8_t*, and unsigned *short* can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned *int* otherwise.
- If *char* is signed by default, the *char* follows the signed char conversion rules above. If the *char* is unsigned by default, the *char* follows the unsigned char rules above.
- *bool* can be converted to int, with *false* becoming *0* and *true* becoming *1*.

Integral promotion does not necessarily preserve the signedness of a type.
