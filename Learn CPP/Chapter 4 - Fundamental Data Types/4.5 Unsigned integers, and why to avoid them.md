## Unsigned integers
**Unsigned Integers:** Integers that can only hold non-negative whole numbers.

## Defining unsigned integers
```cpp
unsigned short us;
unsigned int ui;
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long long ull;
```

## Unsigned integer range
An n-bit unsigned variable has a range of 0 to (2^n)-1.

| Size/Type       | Range                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 byte unsigned | 0 to 255                        |
| 2 byte unsigned | 0 to 65,535                     |
| 4 byte unsigned | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |
| 8 byte unsigned | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |

## Unsigned integer overflow
If an unsigned value is out of range, it is divided by one greater than the largest number of the type, and only the remainder kept.

## When to use unsigned numbers
Unsigned numbers are preferred when doing bit manipulation. 

Unsigned numbers are used when well-defined wrap-around behavior is required.

Unsigned numbers are also common in embedded system development.
