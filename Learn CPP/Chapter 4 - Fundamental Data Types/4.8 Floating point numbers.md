**Floating Point:** Type that can hold real numbers. *Floating* refers to the idea that the decimal point can support a variable number of digits before and after the decimal point.

On modern architectures, floating point representation almost always follow IEE 754 binary format. 

Floating point data types are always signed.

| Category       | Type        | Minimum Size | Typical Size       |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------|
| floating point | float       | 4 bytes      | 4 bytes            |
|                | double      | 8 bytes      | 8 bytes            |
|                | long double | 8 bytes      | 8, 12, or 16 bytes |

## Defining floating point numbers
```cpp
float fValue;
double dValue;
long double ldValue;
```

```cpp
int x{5}; // 5 means integer
double y{5.0}; // 5.0 is a floating point literal (no suffix means double type by default)
float z{5.0f}; // 5.0 is a floating point literal, f suffix means float type
```

###### Best practice
Always make sure the type of your literals match the type of the variables they’re being assigned to or used to initialize. Otherwise an unnecessary conversion will result, possibly with a loss of precision.

## Floating point range
Assuming IEEE 754 representation:
| Size                                    | Range                                | Precision                              |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 4 bytes                                 | ±1.18 x 10^-38  to ±3.4 x 10^38      | 6-9 significant digits, typically 7    |
| 8 bytes                                 | ±2.23 x 10^-308  to ±1.80 x 10^308   | 15-18 significant digits, typically 16 |
| 80-bits (typically uses 12 or 16 bytes) | ±3.36 x 10^-4932  to ±1.18 x 10^4932 | 18-21 significant digits               |
| 16 bytes                                | ±3.36 x 10^-4932 to ±1.18 x 10^4932    | 33-36 significant digits               |

## Rounding errors make floating point comparisons tricky
Floating point numbers are tricky to work with due to non-obvious differences between binary (how data is stored) and decimal (how we think) numbers.

## NaN and Inf
**Inf:** Represents infinity. Inf can be positive or negative.
**NaN:** Not a Number.

Inf and NaN are only available to compilers that use IEE 754 for floating point numbers.
