**Char:** Type designe to hold a single character. A character can be a single letter, number, symbol. or whitespace.

The char type is an integral type (underlying value is stored as an integer). 

**ASCII:** Defines a particular way to represent English characters. 

## Initializing chars
Can initialize char variables using character literals
```cpp
char ch2{ 'a' }; // initialize with code point for 'a' (stored as integer 97) (preferred)
```

Can initialize char variables using integers.
```cpp
char ch1{ 97 }; // initialize with integer 97 ('a') (not preferred)
```

## Char size, range, and default sign
Char is defined to always be 1 byte in size.

A char may be signed or unsigned. When using a char to hold ASCII characters, do not need to specify a sign. When using a char to hold small integers, do specify a sign.

## The other char types, wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t
wchar_t should be avoided unless interfacing with the Windows API. 

char8_t, char16_t and char32_t are provided to support 16-bit and 32-bit uncode characters.
