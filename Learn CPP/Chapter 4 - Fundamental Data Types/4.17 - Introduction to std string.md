## String length
*std::string:length()* returns an unsigned integral value.

```cpp
int length { static_cast<int>(name.length()) };
```

*std::ssize()* returns the length of a std::string as a signed integer.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string name{ "Alex" };
    std::cout << name << " has " << std::ssize(name) << " characters\n";

    return 0;
}
```

## std::string is expensive to initialize and copy
Whenever a *std::string* is initialized, a copy of the string used to initialize it is made. And whenever a *std::string* is passed by value to a *std::string* parameter, another copy is made. These copies are expensive, and should be avoided if possible.

###### Best practice
Do not pass *std::string* by value, as making copies of *std::string* is expensive. Prefer *std::string* parameters.

## Literals for std::string
Double-quoted string literals are C-style strings by default.

Can create string literals with type *std::string* by using a *s* suffix.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>      // for std::string
#include <string_view> // for std::string_view

int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals; // easiest way to access the s and sv suffixes

    std::cout << "foo\n";   // no suffix is a C-style string literal
    std::cout << "goo\n"s;  // s suffix is a std::string literal
    std::cout << "moo\n"sv; // sv suffix is a std::string_view literal

    return 0;
};
```

## Constexpr strings
*constexpr std::string* is not supported in C++17 and barely in C++20.

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
Write a program that asks the user to enter their full name and their age. As output, tell the user the sum of their age and the number of letters in their name (use the `std::string::length()` member function to get the length of the string). For simplicity, count any spaces in the name as a letter.

Sample output:
```
Enter your full name: John Doe
Enter your age: 32
Your age + length of name is: 40
```
Reminder: std::string::length() returns an unsigned int. You should static_cast this to an int before adding the age so you donâ€™t mix signed and unsigned values.
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter your full name: ";
    std::string name{};
    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, name); // read a full line of text into name

    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
    int age{}; // age needs to be an integer, not a string, so we can do math with it
    std::cin >> age;

    // age is signed, and name.length() is unsigned -- we shouldn't mix these
    // We'll convert name.length() to a signed value
    int letters{ static_cast<int>(name.length()) }; // get number of letters in name (including spaces)
    std::cout << "Your age + length of name is: " << age + letters << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
