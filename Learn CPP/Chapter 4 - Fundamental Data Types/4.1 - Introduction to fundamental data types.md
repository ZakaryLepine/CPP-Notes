## Bits, bytes, and memory addressing
**Binary Digit (Bit):** Smallest unit of memory. Can hold a value of 0 or 1.
**Memory Addresses:** Unique identifier. Sequential units. Allow the computer to find and access the contents of memory.

In modern computer architecture, each bit does not get its own unique memory address. The number of memory addresses is finite and it is rarely necessary to access data bit-by-bit. 

**Byte:** Group of bits that are operated on as a unit. 

In modern computer architecture, each memory address holds 1 byte of data. Modern standards dictate that a byte is comprised of 8 sequential bits.

## Data types
**Data Type:** Tells the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory. 

When an object is given a value, the compiler and CPU encodes the value into the appropriate sequence of bits for that data type. 

When an object is evaluated to produce a value, the sequence of bits is reconstituted back into the original value.

## Fundamental data types
**Fundamental Data Types (Basic Types, Primitive Types, Built-In Types):** Types that are supported by default.
