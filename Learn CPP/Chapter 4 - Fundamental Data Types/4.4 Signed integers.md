**Integer:** Integral type that can represent positive and negative whole numbers.

| Type          | Minimum Size | Note                                    |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| short int     | 16 bits      |                                         |
| int           | 16 bits      | Usually 32 bits on modern architectures |
| long int      | 32 bits      |                                         |
| long long int | 64 bits      |                                         |

## Signed integers
**Signed:** Number's sign is stored as part of the number (usually in a single bit).

## Defining signed integers
```cpp
short s;      // prefer "short" instead of "short int"
int i;
long l;       // prefer "long" instead of "long int"
long long ll; // prefer "long long" instead of "long long int"
```

## Signed integer ranges
An n-bit signed variable has a range of -(2^(n-1)) tp 2^(n-1)-1.

| Size/Type      | Range                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 bit signed   | -128 to 127                                             |
| 16 bit signed  | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| 32 bit signed  | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| 64 bit signed  | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

## Integer overflow
**Integer Overflow:** Occurs when tring to store a value that is outside the range of the type. Leads to undefined behavior.

## Integer division
**Integer Division:** Division with two integers.

Since integers cannot hold fractional values, any fractional portion is dropped.
