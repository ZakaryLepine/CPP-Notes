When a C++ program is executed, the program executes sequentially, beginning at the top of main(). When a function call is encountered, the point of execution jumps to the beginning of the function being called.

How does the CPU know do do this?

When a program is compiled, the compiler converts each statement in a C++ program into one or more lines of machine language. Each line of machine language is given its own unique sequential address. When a function is encountered, the function is converted into machine language and given the next available address. Each function ends up with a unique address.

**Binding** refers to the process used to convert identifiers (e.g.: variable names, function names) into addresses. 

## Earling binding
Most function calls encountered by a compiler are direct function calls. Direct function calls are statements that directly call a function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printValue(int value)
{
    std::cout << value;
}

int main()
{
    printValue(5); // This is a direct function call
    return 0;
}
```

Direct function calls are resolved using early binding.

**Early (static) binding** refers to the process where a compiler (or linker) can directly associate an identifier name with a machine address.

When a compiler (or linker) encounters a function call, the compiler (or linker) replaces the function call with machine language instructions that tells the CPU to jump to the address of the function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int subtract(int x, int y)
{
    return x - y;
}

int multiply(int x, int y)
{
    return x * y;
}

int main()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    int y{};
    std::cout << "Enter another number: ";
    std::cin >> y;

    int op{};
    do
    {
        std::cout << "Enter an operation (0=add, 1=subtract, 2=multiply): ";
        std::cin >> op;
    } while (op < 0 || op > 2);

    int result {};
    switch (op)
    {
        // call the target function directly using early binding
        case 0: result = add(x, y); break;
        case 1: result = subtract(x, y); break;
        case 2: result = multiply(x, y); break;
    }

    std::cout << "The answer is: " << result << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Late binding
**Late (dynamic) binding** refers to the process where a compiler (or linker) cannot resolve a function call until runtime.

Late binding is slightly less efficient than early binding because late binding involves an extra level of indirection. The program must read the address held in the pointer and then jump to the address. 

Late binding occurs using function pointers. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int subtract(int x, int y)
{
    return x - y;
}

int multiply(int x, int y)
{
    return x * y;
}

int main()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    int y{};
    std::cout << "Enter another number: ";
    std::cin >> y;

    int op{};
    do
    {
        std::cout << "Enter an operation (0=add, 1=subtract, 2=multiply): ";
        std::cin >> op;
    } while (op < 0 || op > 2);

    // Create a function pointer named pFcn (yes, the syntax is ugly)
    int (*pFcn)(int, int) { nullptr };

    // Set pFcn to point to the function the user chose
    switch (op)
    {
        case 0: pFcn = add; break;
        case 1: pFcn = subtract; break;
        case 2: pFcn = multiply; break;
    }

    // Call the function that pFcn is pointing to with x and y as parameters
    // This uses late binding
    std::cout << "The answer is: " << pFcn(x, y) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
