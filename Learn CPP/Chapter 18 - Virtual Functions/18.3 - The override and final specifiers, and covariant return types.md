C++ has 2 inheritance-related identifiers:
- override
- final

These identifiers are not keywords and have special meaning only when used in specific contexts.

## The override specifier
To help address the issue of functions that are meant to be overrides but are not (due to different signatures or return types), the *override* specifier can be used after the function signature.

If a function marked with the *override* specifier does not override a base class function, a compiler error occurs.

The override specifier has no performance penatly because it is checked at compile time.

```cpp
#include <string_view>

class A
{
public:
	virtual std::string_view getName1(int x) { return "A"; }
	virtual std::string_view getName2(int x) { return "A"; }
	virtual std::string_view getName3(int x) { return "A"; }
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	std::string_view getName1(short int x) override { return "B"; } // compile error, function is not an override
	std::string_view getName2(int x) const override { return "B"; } // compile error, function is not an override
	std::string_view getName3(int x) override { return "B"; } // okay, function is an override of A::getName3(int)

};

int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Use the virtual keyword on virtual functions in a base class. Use the override specifier (but not the virtual keyword) on override functions in derived classes.

## The final specifier
The *final* specifier is placed after a function signature to indicate that the virtual function should not be overridable.

```CPP
#include <string_view>

class A
{
public:
	virtual std::string_view getName() { return "A"; }
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	// note use of final specifier on following line -- that makes this function no longer overridable
	std::string_view getName() override final { return "B"; } // okay, overrides A::getName()
};

class C : public B
{
public:
	std::string_view getName() override { return "C"; } // compile error: overrides B::getName(), which is final
};
```

The *final specifier* is placed after a class name to prevent the class from being inherited from.
```cpp
#include <string_view>

class A
{
public:
	virtual std::string_view getName() { return "A"; }
};

class B final : public A // note use of final specifier here
{
public:
	std::string_view getName() override { return "B"; }
};

class C : public B // compile error: cannot inherit from final class
{
public:
	std::string_view getName() override { return "C"; }
};
```

## Covariant return types
There is a special case where a derive class virtual function can have a different return type than the base class virtual function and be considered a matching override.

If the return type of a virtual function is a pointer or a reference to a class, virutal override functions can return a pointer or reference to a derived class. These are called **covariant return types**.

C++ cannot dynamically select types so covariant return types always return the type that matches the actual version of the function being called. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

class Base
{
public:
	// This version of getThis() returns a pointer to a Base class
	virtual Base* getThis() { std::cout << "called Base::getThis()\n"; return this; }
	void printType() { std::cout << "returned a Base\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	// Normally override functions have to return objects of the same type as the base function
	// However, because Derived is derived from Base, it's okay to return Derived* instead of Base*
	Derived* getThis() override { std::cout << "called Derived::getThis()\n";  return this; }
	void printType() { std::cout << "returned a Derived\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	Derived d{};
	Base* b{ &d };
	d.getThis()->printType(); // calls Derived::getThis(), returns a Derived*, calls Derived::printType
	b->getThis()->printType(); // calls Derived::getThis(), returns a Base*, calls Base::printType. The Derived* is upcast to Base* b/c the Base version of the function returns a Base.

	return 0;
}
```

```
called Derived::getThis()
returned a Derived
called Derived::getThis()
returned a Base
```

Covariant return types are often used when a virtual member function returns a pointer/reference to the class containing the member function.

Covariant return types can be used in any case where the return type of the override member function is derived from the return type of the base virtual member function.

In all cases, because `get()` has a covariant return type, the return type of `get()` will be the return type of the `get()` member function of the implicit object.

Case 1 is straightforward. In both statements, `d.get()` calls `D::get()`, which returns `m_b`. Because `get()` is being called on `d`, which is of type `D`, the return type of `D::get()` is used, which is type `B&`. The calls to `print()` and `vprint()` resolve to `B::print()` and `B::vprint()` respectively.

Case 2 is also straightforward. In both statements, `c.get()` calls `C::get()`, which returns `m_a`. Because `get()` is being called on `c`, which is of type `C`, the return type of `C::get()` is used, which is type `A&`. The calls to `print()` and `vprint()` resolve to `A::print()` and `A::vprint()` respectively.

Case 3 is the interesting one. `ref` is a `C&` referencing a `D`. `ref.get()` is a virtual function, so `ref.get()` virtually resolves to `D::get()`, which returns `m_b`. However, `get()` has a covariant return type, so the return type of `get()` is determined by the type of the implicit object that `get()` is called on. Since `ref` is a `C&`, the return type of `C::get()` is used, which means the return type of `ref.get()` is `A&` (referencing object `m_b`, which is a `B`).

Because the return type of `ref.get()` is an `A&`, non-virtual function call `ref.get().print()` resolves to `A::print()`.

When virtual function `ref.get().vprint()` is called, virtual function resolution is used. Although the return type of `ref.get()` is an `A&`, the object being reference is actually a `B`. Therefore, `B::vprint()` is called.
