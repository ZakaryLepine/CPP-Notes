## The need for dynamic_cast
When dealing with polymorphism, often times, a pointer to a base class is given but accessing information of the derived class is necessary.

**Upcasting** is the process of converting a derived class pointer into a base class pointer.

C++ can implicitly upcast.

**Downcasting** is the process of converting a derived class pointer into a base class pointer.


C++ cannot implicitly downcast.

## dynamic_cast
The most common use for **dynamic_cast** is to convert base class pointers into derived-class pointers. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Base
{
protected:
	int m_value{};

public:
	Base(int value)
		: m_value{value}
	{
	}

	virtual ~Base() = default;
};

class Derived : public Base
{
protected:
	std::string m_name{};

public:
	Derived(int value, std::string_view name)
		: Base{value}, m_name{name}
	{
	}

	const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
};

Base* getObject(bool returnDerived)
{
	if (returnDerived)
		return new Derived{1, "Apple"};
	else
		return new Base{2};
}

int main()
{
	Base* b{ getObject(true) };

	Derived* d{ dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b) }; // use dynamic cast to convert Base pointer into Derived pointer

	std::cout << "The name of the Derived is: " << d->getName() << '\n';

	delete b;

	return 0;
}
```

```
The name of the Derived is: Apple
```

## dynamic_cast failure
When a dynamic cast fails, the result of the conversion is a null pointer.

A dynamic cast can fail when a base class pointer does not hold an object of the type that is being dynmaically casted to.

When using dynamic_cast, always check for a null pointer before using the resulting pointer.

```cpp
int main()
{
	Base* b{ getObject(true) };

	Derived* d{ dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b) }; // use dynamic cast to convert Base pointer into Derived pointer

	if (d) // make sure d is non-null
		std::cout << "The name of the Derived is: " << d->getName() << '\n';

	delete b;

	return 0;
}
```

Downcasting using dynamic_cast fails for:
- Protected/Private inheritance.
- For classes that do not declare or inherit any virtual functions (do not have a virtual table).
- In certain cases involving virtual base classes.

## Downcasting with static_cast
Downcasting can be done using static_cast.

Downcasting with static_cast does no runtime type checking to ensure that the downcasting makes sense. 

Downcasting with static_cast is more dangerous but more performant than downcasting with dynamic_cast.

## dynamic_cast and references
Downcasting with dynamic_cast works with references.

When a dynamic_cast fails with a reference, a std::bad_cast exception is thrown. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Base
{
protected:
	int m_value;

public:
	Base(int value)
		: m_value{value}
	{
	}

	virtual ~Base() = default;
};

class Derived : public Base
{
protected:
	std::string m_name;

public:
	Derived(int value, std::string_view name)
		: Base{value}, m_name{name}
	{
	}

	const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
};

int main()
{
	Derived apple{1, "Apple"}; // create an apple
	Base& b{ apple }; // set base reference to object
	Derived& d{ dynamic_cast<Derived&>(b) }; // dynamic cast using a reference instead of a pointer

	std::cout << "The name of the Derived is: " << d.getName() << '\n'; // we can access Derived::getName through d

	return 0;
}
```

## dynamic_cast vs static_cast
Use dynamic_cast when downcasting.

Use static_cast every other time.

If possible, avoid downcasting and use virtual functions.

## Downcasting vs virtual functions
In general, virtual functions are preferred over downcasting.

Downcasting is preferred to virtual functions when:
- Can not modify a base class to add a virtual function (e.g.: standard library class).
- Need to access something that is derived-class specific (e.g.: access function that only exists in a derived class).
- Adding a virtual function to a base class does not make sense (e.g.: no appropriate value for the base class to return). Using a pure virtual function can be option when the base class does not need to be instantiated.
