## Virtual destructors
Non-default provided destructors should **always** be virtual when dealing with inheritance.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    virtual ~Base() // note: virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Base()\n";
    }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
private:
    int* m_array {};

public:
    Derived(int length)
      : m_array{ new int[length] }
    {
    }

    virtual ~Derived() // note: virtual
    {
        std::cout << "Calling ~Derived()\n";
        delete[] m_array;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Derived* derived { new Derived(5) };
    Base* base { derived }; 

    delete base; //If Base destructor is not virtual, the derived classes destructor will not be called.

    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
Calling ~Derived()
Calling ~Base()
```

Can make a base class have a virtual empty destructor.
```cpp
virtual ~Base() = default; // generate a virtual default destructor
```

## Ignoring virtualization
Virtualization of a function can be ignored by using the scope resolution operator.
```cpp
#include <string_view>
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
    virtual ~Base() = default;
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "Base"; }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "Derived"; }
};


int main()
{
    Derived derived {};
    const Base& base { derived };

    // Calls Base::getName() instead of the virtualized Derived::getName()
    std::cout << base.Base::getName() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Should all destructors be virtual?
Making all destructors virtual has a performance penalty because a virtual pointer is added to every instance of the class.

"A base class destructor should be public and virtual or protected and non-virtual".

A class with a protected destructor cannot be deleted via a pointer which prevents the accidental deleting of a derived class through a base pointer when the base class has a non-virtual destructor. Unfortunately, making the base class destructor protected prevents base class pointers from being deleted. Therefore, the base class cannot be dynamically allocated, deleted except from a derived class., or allocated on the stack.

- If intending for a class to be inherited from, the destructor should be virtual.
- If not intending for a class to be inherited from, make the class final. Therefore, preventing other classes from inheriting from the class.
