C++ implements virtual functions using a special form of late binding.

The **virtual table** is a lookup table of functions used to resolve function calls in a dynamic binding manner.

Every class that uses virtual functions (or is derived from a class that uses virtual functions) is given its own virtual table.

The virtual table is a static array that the compiler sets up at compile time. A virtual table contains 1 entry for each virtual function that can be called by objects of the class. Each entry in the table is a function pointer that points to the most-derived function accessible by the class.

The compiler creates a hidden pointer that is a membert of the base class that points to its virtual table. The hidden pointer is set automatically when a class object is created to point to the virtual table of the class. Each class object allocated is bigger than the true size of the class by the size of the hidden pointer. Derived classes inherit the hidden pointer.

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
    virtual void function1() {};
    virtual void function2() {};
};

class D1: public Base
{
public:
    void function1() override {};
};

class D2: public Base
{
public:
    void function2() override {};
};
```

```cpp
int main()
{
    D1 d1 {};
    Base* dPtr = &d1;
    dPtr->function1();

    return 0;
}
```

d1 is a D1 object so d1's hidden pointer is set to the D1 virtual table.

Since dPtr is a base pointer, dPtr only has access to the Base portion of d1. 

Since the hidden pointer is a member of the Base class, dPtr has access to the hidden pointer.

Since the Base pointer points to a D1 object, the pointer points to the D1 virtual table.

When a virtual function is called, the program recognizes that the function is a virtual function. The program uses the hidden pointer to ge the virtual table. The program uses the virtual table to call the function being pointed to (the most derived virtual function. e.g.: D1::function1()) in the virtual table.

```cpp
int main()
{
    Base b {};
    Base* bPtr = &b;
    bPtr->function1();

    return 0;
}
```

b is a Base object so b's hidden pointer is set to the Base virtual table.

When a virtual function is called, the program recognizes that the function is a virtual function. The program uses the hidden pointer to get the virtual table. The program uses the virtual table to call the function being pointed to in the virtual table (Base::function1()).

Virtual functions are slowing than non-virtual functions because:
- The hidden pointer is used to get to the appropriate virtual table.
- The virtual table is indexed to find the function to call.
- The function is called.
