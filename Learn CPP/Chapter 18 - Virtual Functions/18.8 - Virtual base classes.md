## The diamond problem
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class PoweredDevice
{
public:
    PoweredDevice(int power)
    {
		std::cout << "PoweredDevice: " << power << '\n';
    }
};

class Scanner: public PoweredDevice
{
public:
    Scanner(int scanner, int power)
        : PoweredDevice{ power }
    {
		std::cout << "Scanner: " << scanner << '\n';
    }
};

class Printer: public PoweredDevice
{
public:
    Printer(int printer, int power)
        : PoweredDevice{ power }
    {
		std::cout << "Printer: " << printer << '\n';
    }
};

class Copier: public Scanner, public Printer
{
public:
    Copier(int scanner, int printer, int power)
        : Scanner{ scanner, power }, Printer{ printer, power }
    {
    }
};

int main()
{
    Copier copier{ 1, 2, 3 };

    return 0;
}
```

```
PoweredDevice: 3
Scanner: 1
PoweredDevice: 3
Printer: 2
```

If a Copier class object is instantiated, 2 copies of the PoweredDevice class would be created.

## Virtual base classes
A **virtual base class** is a base class that is shared. A virtual base class means that only 1 base object is created.

The bast object is shared between all objects in the inheritance tree and the base object is only constructed once.

A base class can be shared by using the *virtual* keyword in the inheritance list of the derived class.

Virtual base classes are always created before non-virtual base classes to ensure that all bases are created before their derived classes.

The most derived class that includes all instances of the virtually inherited class calls the constructor.

Classes that directly inherit from a virtual base class must still call the constructor of the virtual base class.

All classes inheriting a virtual base class will have a virtual table. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class PoweredDevice
{
public:
    PoweredDevice(int power)
    {
		std::cout << "PoweredDevice: " << power << '\n';
    }
};

class Scanner: virtual public PoweredDevice // note: PoweredDevice is now a virtual base class
{
public:
    Scanner(int scanner, int power)
        : PoweredDevice{ power } // this line is required to create Scanner objects, but ignored in this case
    {
		std::cout << "Scanner: " << scanner << '\n';
    }
};

class Printer: virtual public PoweredDevice // note: PoweredDevice is now a virtual base class
{
public:
    Printer(int printer, int power)
        : PoweredDevice{ power } // this line is required to create Printer objects, but ignored in this case
    {
		std::cout << "Printer: " << printer << '\n';
    }
};

class Copier: public Scanner, public Printer
{
public:
    Copier(int scanner, int printer, int power)
        : PoweredDevice{ power }, // PoweredDevice is constructed here
        Scanner{ scanner, power }, Printer{ printer, power }
    {
    }
};

int main()
{
    Copier copier{ 1, 2, 3 };

    return 0;
}
```

```
PoweredDevice: 3
Scanner: 1
Printer: 2
```
