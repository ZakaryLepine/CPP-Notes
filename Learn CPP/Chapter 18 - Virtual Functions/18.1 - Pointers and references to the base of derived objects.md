## Pointers, references, and derived classes
Can set derived class pointers to point to a derived class object and references to a derived class object.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Derived derived{ 5 };
    std::cout << "derived is a " << derived.getName() << " and has value " << derived.getValue() << '\n';

    Derived& rDerived{ derived };
    std::cout << "rDerived is a " << rDerived.getName() << " and has value " << rDerived.getValue() << '\n';

    Derived* pDerived{ &derived };
    std::cout << "pDerived is a " << pDerived->getName() << " and has value " << pDerived->getValue() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
derived is a Derived and has value 5
rDerived is a Derived and has value 5
pDerived is a Derived and has value 5
```

Can set base clase pointers to point to a derived class object.

Base class pointers pointing to derive class objects can only see members of the base class (or any classes that the base class inherits from).
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Derived derived{ 5 };

    // These are both legal!
    Base& rBase{ derived };
    Base* pBase{ &derived };

    std::cout << "derived is a " << derived.getName() << " and has value " << derived.getValue() << '\n';
    std::cout << "rBase is a " << rBase.getName() << " and has value " << rBase.getValue() << '\n';
    std::cout << "pBase is a " << pBase->getName() << " and has value " << pBase->getValue() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
derived is a Derived and has value 5
rBase is a Base and has value 5
pBase is a Base and has value 5
```

## Use for pointers and references to base classes
Creating functions that take a base class  pointer parameter allows pointers to base class objects and pointers to derived class objects to be passed into the function.

Creating containers that hold the base class pointer allows pointers to base class objects and pointers to derived class objects to be held within the container.

### Question 1
#### Question
Our Animal/Cat/Dog example above doesn’t work like we want because a reference or pointer to an Animal can’t access the derived version of speak() needed to return the right value for the Cat or Dog. One way to work around this issue would be to make the data returned by the speak() function accessible as part of the Animal base class (much like the Animal’s name is accessible via member m_name).

Update the Animal, Cat, and Dog classes in the lesson above by adding a new member to Animal named m_speak. Initialize it appropriately. The following program should work properly:
```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const Cat fred{ "Fred" };
    const Cat misty{ "Misty" };
    const Cat zeke{ "Zeke" };

    const Dog garbo{ "Garbo" };
    const Dog pooky{ "Pooky" };
    const Dog truffle{ "Truffle" };

    // Set up an array of pointers to animals, and set those pointers to our Cat and Dog objects
    const auto animals{ std::to_array<const Animal*>({ &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke }) };

    // Before C++20, with the array size being explicitly specified
    // const std::array<const Animal*, 6> animals{ &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke };

    for (const auto animal : animals)
    {
        std::cout << animal->getName() << " says " << animal->speak() << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <array>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
#include <iostream>

class Animal
{
protected:
    std::string m_name;
    std::string m_speak;

    // We're making this constructor protected because
    // we don't want people creating Animal objects directly,
    // but we still want derived classes to be able to use it.
    Animal(std::string_view name, std::string_view speak)
        : m_name{ name }, m_speak{ speak }
    {
    }

    // To prevent slicing (covered later)
    Animal(const Animal&) = delete;
    Animal& operator=(const Animal&) = delete;

public:
    std::string_view getName() const { return m_name; }
    std::string_view speak() const { return m_speak; }
};

class Cat: public Animal
{
public:
    Cat(std::string_view name)
        : Animal{ name, "Meow" }
    {
    }
};

class Dog: public Animal
{
public:
    Dog(std::string_view name)
        : Animal{ name, "Woof" }
    {
    }
};

int main()
{
    const Cat fred{ "Fred" };
    const Cat misty{ "Misty" };
    const Cat zeke{ "Zeke" };

    const Dog garbo{ "Garbo" };
    const Dog pooky{ "Pooky" };
    const Dog truffle{ "Truffle" };

    // Set up an array of pointers to animals, and set those pointers to our Cat and Dog objects
    const auto animals{ std::to_array<const Animal*>({ &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke }) };

    // Before C++20, with the array size being explicitly specified
    // const std::array<const Animal*, 6> animals{ &fred, &garbo, &misty, &pooky, &truffle, &zeke };

    // animal is not a reference, because we're looping over pointers
    for (const auto animal : animals)
    {
        std::cout << animal->getName() << " says " << animal->speak() << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Question 2
#### Question
Why is the above solution non-optimal?

Hint: Think about the future state of Cat and Dog where we want to differentiate Cats and Dogs in more ways.  
Hint: Think about the ways in which having a member that needs to be set at initialization limits you.
#### Answer
The current solution is non-optimal for a number of reasons.

First, we need to add a member to Animal for each way we want to differentiate Cat and Dog. Over time, our Animal class could become quite large memory-wise, and complicated!

Second, this solution only works if the base class member can be determined at initialization time. For example, if speak() returned a randomized result for each Animal (e.g. calling Dog::speak() could return “woof”, “arf”, or “yip”), this kind of solution starts to get awkward and fall apart.

Third, because speak() is a member of Animal, speak() will have the same behavior for Cats and Dogs (that is, it will always return m_speak). If we wanted `speak()` to have different behavior for Cats and Dogs (e.g. have Dogs return a random sound), we’d have to put all that extra logic in Animal, which makes Animal even more complex.
