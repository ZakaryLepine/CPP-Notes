## Pure virtual (abstract) functions and abstract base classes
**Pure virtual functions (abstract functions)** are virtual functions with no body.

A pure virtual function acts as a placeholder that is meant to be redefined by derived classes.

A pure virtual function can be made created by assigning the function the value 0 instead of the defining a function body.
```cpp
#include <string_view>

class Base
{
public:
    std::string_view sayHi() const { return "Hi"; } // a normal non-virtual function

    virtual std::string_view getName() const { return "Base"; } // a normal virtual function

    virtual int getValue() const = 0; // a pure virtual function

    int doSomething() = 0; // Compile error: can not set non-virtual functions to 0
};
```

**Abstract base classes** are classes that have 1 or more pure virtual functions.

Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated because not all of the functions of the abstract base class are defined.

```cpp
int main()
{
    Base base {}; // We can't instantiate an abstract base class, but for the sake of example, pretend this was allowed
    base.getValue(); // what would this do?

    return 0;
}
```

Any derived class must define a body for pure virtual functions.

If bodies for the pure virtual functions are not defined in the derived class, the derived class is also an abstract base class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Animal // This Animal is an abstract base class
{
protected:
    std::string m_name {};

public:
    Animal(std::string_view name)
        : m_name{ name }
    {
    }

    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    virtual std::string_view speak() const = 0; // note that speak is now a pure virtual function

    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

class Cow: public Animal
{
public:
    Cow(std::string_view name)
        : Animal(name)
    {
    }

    std::string_view speak() const override { return "Moo"; }
};

int main()
{
    Cow cow{ "Betsy" };
    std::cout << cow.getName() << " says " << cow.speak() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

Pure virtual functions can called using a base class reference (or pointer).
```cpp
int main()
{
    Cow cow{ "Betsy" };
    Animal& a{ cow };

    std::cout << a.speak(); // resolves to Cow::speak(), prints "Moo"

    return 0;
}
```

## Pure virtual functions with definitions
Pure virtual functions can have definitions.

The pure virtual function must be provided separately. The pure virtual function cannot be inline.

Since the pure virtual function is a pure virtual function, the base class is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated. 

Since the pure virtual function is a pure virtual function, derived classes must define a body for the pure virtual function. If the derived classes do not define a body for the pure virtual function, the derived classes are also abstract classes.

```cpp
#include <string>

class Animal // This Animal is an abstract base class
{
protected:
    std::string m_name {};

public:
    Animal(const std::string& name)
        : m_name{ name }
    {
    }

    std::string getName() { return m_name; }
    virtual const char* speak() const = 0; // The = 0 means this function is pure virtual

    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

const char* Animal::speak() const  // even though it has a definition
{
    return "buzz";
}
```

Pure virtual functions with definitions can be used to provide a default implementation for the pure virtual functions but force derived classes to provide their own implementations of the function.

If a derived class wants to use the default implementation, a derived class can define the function as calling the base class implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Animal // This Animal is an abstract base class
{
protected:
    std::string m_name {};

public:
    Animal(std::string_view name)
        : m_name(name)
    {
    }

    const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
    virtual std::string_view speak() const = 0; // note that speak is a pure virtual function

    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

const char* Animal::speak() const
{
    return "buzz"; // some default implementation
}

class Dragonfly: public Animal
{

public:
    Dragonfly(std::string_view name)
        : Animal{name}
    {
    }

    std::string_view speak() const override// this class is no longer abstract because we defined this function
    {
        return Animal::speak(); // use Animal's default implementation
    }
};

int main()
{
    Dragonfly dfly{"Sally"};
    std::cout << dfly.getName() << " says " << dfly.speak() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

A destructor can be made pure virtual, but must be given a definition so that it can be called when a derived object is destructed.

## Interface classes
An **interface class** is a class that has no member values and where all functions are pure virtual.

The class is purely a definition and has no actual implementation. 

Interfaces can be used to define functionality that derived classes must implement but the interface leaves the implementation details to the derived classes.

The interface class must include a virtual destructor to allow derived destructors to be called when a pointer to the interface is deleted.

```cpp
#include <string_view>

class IErrorLog
{
public:
    virtual bool openLog(std::string_view filename) = 0;
    virtual bool closeLog() = 0;

    virtual bool writeError(std::string_view errorMessage) = 0;

    virtual ~IErrorLog() {} // make a virtual destructor in case we delete an IErrorLog pointer, so the proper derived destructor is called
};

#include <cmath> // for sqrt()
double mySqrt(double value, IErrorLog& log)
{
    if (value < 0.0)
    {
        log.writeError("Tried to take square root of value less than 0");
        return 0.0;
    }
    else
    {
        return std::sqrt(value);
    }
}
```
