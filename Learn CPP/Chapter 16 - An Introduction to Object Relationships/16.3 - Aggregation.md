## Aggregation
A whole object and its parts qualify as an aggregation when:
- The part (member) is part of the object (class).
- The part (member) can belong to more than 1 object (class) at a time.
- The part (member) does not have its existence managed by the object (class).
- The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class).

Aggregation can be singular or multiplicative.

## Implementing aggregations
Aggregations are implemented as structs/classes with reference/pointer member variables.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Teacher
{
private:
  std::string m_name{};

public:
  Teacher(const std::string& name)
      : m_name{ name }
  {
  }

  const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
};

class Department
{
private:
  const Teacher& m_teacher; // This dept holds only one teacher for simplicity, but it could hold many teachers

public:
  Department(const Teacher& teacher)
      : m_teacher{ teacher }
  {
  }
};

int main()
{
  // Create a teacher outside the scope of the Department
  Teacher bob{ "Bob" }; // create a teacher

  {
    // Create a department and use the constructor parameter to pass
    // the teacher to it.
    Department department{ bob };

  } // department goes out of scope here and is destroyed

  // bob still exists here, but the department doesn't

  std::cout << bob.getName() << " still exists!\n";

  return 0;
}
```

## std::reference_wrapper
std::reference_wrapper is a class that acts like a reference but also allows assignment and copying.

std::reference_wrapper can be used with containers (e.g.: std::vector) because containers elements must be assignable.

3 things to know about std::reference_wrapper:
1. std::reference_wrapper lives in the \<functional> header
2. The object that is wrapped by a std::reference_wrapper cannot be an anonymous object.
3. The get() member function can be used to get the object back out of a std::reference_wrapper.

```cpp
#include <functional> // std::reference_wrapper
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main()
{
  std::string tom{ "Tom" };
  std::string berta{ "Berta" };

  std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<std::string>> names{ tom, berta }; // these strings are stored by reference, not value

  std::string jim{ "Jim" };

  names.push_back(jim);

  for (auto name : names)
  {
    // Use the get() member function to get the referenced string.
    name.get() += " Beam";
  }

  std::cout << jim << '\n'; // Jim Beam

  return 0;
}
```

### Question 1
#### Question
Would you be more likely to implement the following as a composition or an aggregation?  
a) A ball that has a color  
b) An employer that is employing multiple people  
c) The departments in a university  
d) Your age  
e) A bag of marbles
#### Answer
a) Composition
b) Aggregation
c) Composition
d) Composition
e) Aggregation

### Question 2
#### Question
Update the `Department`/`Teacher` example so the `Department` can handle multiple Teachers. The following code should execute:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// ...

int main()
{
  // Create a teacher outside the scope of the Department
  Teacher t1{ "Bob" };
  Teacher t2{ "Frank" };
  Teacher t3{ "Beth" };

  {
    // Create a department and add some Teachers to it
    Department department{}; // create an empty Department

    department.add(t1);
    department.add(t2);
    department.add(t3);

    std::cout << department;

  } // department goes out of scope here and is destroyed

  std::cout << t1.getName() << " still exists!\n";
  std::cout << t2.getName() << " still exists!\n";
  std::cout << t3.getName() << " still exists!\n";

  return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
Department: Bob Frank Beth
Bob still exists!
Frank still exists!
Beth still exists!
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <functional>
#include <vector>

class Teacher
{
private:
  std::string m_name{};

public:
  Teacher(const std::string& name)
      : m_name{ name }
  {
  }

  const std::string& getName() const { return m_name; }
};

class Department
{
private:
  std::vector<std::reference_wrapper<const Teacher>> m_teachers {};

public:
  Department()
  {
  }

	void add(const Teacher& teacher)
	{
		m_teachers.push_back(teacher);
	}

	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Department& department)
	{
		out << "Department: ";
		for (const auto& teacher : department.m_teachers)
		{
			out << teacher.get().getName() << ' ';
		}

		out << '\n';

		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
  // Create a teacher outside the scope of the Department
  Teacher bob{ "Bob" }; // create a teacher

  {
    // Create a department and use the constructor parameter to pass
    // the teacher to it.
    Department department{ bob };

  } // department goes out of scope here and is destroyed

  // bob still exists here, but the department doesn't

  std::cout << bob.getName() << " still exists!\n";

  return 0;
}
```
