A **dependency** occurs when an object invokes another object's functionality in order to accomplish a task. 

Any changes to the object being depended upon can break functionality in the dependent caller.

A dependency is always a unidirectional relationship.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point
{
private:
    double m_x{};
    double m_y{};
    double m_z{};

public:
    Point(double x=0.0, double y=0.0, double z=0.0): m_x{x}, m_y{y}, m_z{z}
    {
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Point& point); // Point has a dependency on std::ostream here
};

std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Point& point)
{
    // Since operator<< is a friend of the Point class, we can access Point's members directly.
    out << "Point(" << point.m_x << ", " << point.m_y << ", " << point.m_z << ')';

    return out;
}

int main()
{
    Point point1 { 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 };

    std::cout << point1; // the program has a dependency on std::cout here

    return 0;
}
```

## Dependencies vs associations 
Associations are relationships between two classes at the class level. One class keeps a direct or indirect link to the associated class as a member.

Dependencies are not represented at the class lelve. The object being depended on is not linked as a member. The object being depended on is instantiated as need or passed into a function as a parameter.
