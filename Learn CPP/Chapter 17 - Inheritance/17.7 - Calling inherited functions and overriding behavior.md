By default, derived classes inherit all behaviors defined in a base class.

## Calling a base class function
When a member function is called with a derived class object, the compiler checks to see if the member function exists in the derived class. If the member function does not exist in the derived class, the compiler walks up the inheritance chain and checks whether the member has been defined in any of the parent classes. The compiler uses the first matching member function found.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
protected:
    int m_value {};

public:
    Base(int value)
        : m_value { value }
    {
    }

    void identify() const { std::cout << "I am a Base\n"; }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived(int value)
        : Base { value }
    {
    }
};
int main()
{
    Base base { 5 };
    base.identify();

    Derived derived { 7 };
    derived.identify();

    return 0;
}
```

```
I am a Base
I am a Base
```

## Redefining behaviors
Can make inherited functions work differently by redefining member functions in the derived class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
protected:
    int m_value {};

public:
    Base(int value)
        : m_value { value }
    {
    }

    void identify() const { std::cout << "I am a Base\n"; }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived(int value)
        : Base { value }
    {
    }

	int getValue() const { return m_value; }

    // Here's our modified function
    void identify() const { std::cout << "I am a Derived\n"; }

};

int main()
{
    Base base { 5 };
    base.identify();

    Derived derived { 7 };
    derived.identify();

    return 0;
}
````

```
I am a Base
I am a Derived
```

A redefined function does not inherit the access specifier of the function with the same name in the base class. The redefined function uses the access specifier the redefined function is defined under in the derived class. Therefore, a function that is defined as private in the base class can be redefined to be public in the derived class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
private:
	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << "Base";
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << "Derived ";
	}
};


int main()
{
	Derived derived;
	derived.print(); // calls derived::print(), which is public
	return 0;
}
```

## Adding to existing functionality
It is possible for a derived function to call the base function of the same name and then add additional functionalities.

To have a derived function call a base function of the same name, prefix the function with the scope qualifier and the name of the base class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived(int value)
        : Base { value }
    {
    }

    int getValue() const  { return m_value; }

    void identify() const
    {
        Base::identify(); // call Base::identify() first
        std::cout << "I am a Derived\n"; // then identify ourselves
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base base { 5 };
    base.identify();

    Derived derived { 7 };
    derived.identify();

    return 0;
}
```

```
I am a Base
I am a Base
I am a Derived
```

When trying to call friend function of a base classes from a derived class, the derived class must be casted to the type of the base class. The scope resolution operator cannot be used to call the friend function of the base class because the friend function is not a member of the base class.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
private:
	int m_value {};

public:
	Base(int value)
		: m_value{ value }
	{
	}

	friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
	{
		out << "In Base\n";
		out << b.m_value << '\n';
		return out;
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	Derived(int value)
		: Base{ value }
	{
	}

	friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Derived& d)
	{
		out << "In Derived\n";
		// static_cast Derived to a Base object, so we call the right version of operator<<
		out << static_cast<const Base&>(d);
		return out;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Derived derived { 7 };

	std::cout << derived << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

```
In Derived
In Base
7
```
