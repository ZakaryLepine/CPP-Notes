## The protected access specifier
The **protected** access specifier allows the class the member belongs to, friends, and derived classes to access the member. Protected members are not accessible from outside the class.

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
    int m_public {}; // can be accessed by anybody
protected:
    int m_protected {}; // can be accessed by Base members, friends, and derived classes
private:
    int m_private {}; // can only be accessed by Base members and friends (but not derived classes)
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived()
    {
        m_public = 1; // allowed: can access public base members from derived class
        m_protected = 2; // allowed: can access protected base members from derived class
        m_private = 3; // not allowed: can not access private base members from derived class
    }
};

int main()
{
    Base base;
    base.m_public = 1; // allowed: can access public members from outside class
    base.m_protected = 2; // not allowed: can not access protected members from outside class
    base.m_private = 3; // not allowed: can not access private members from outside class

    return 0;
}
```

## When to use the protected access specifier
In general, it is better to make members private.

Use protected members when derived classes are planned and the cost to build and maintain an interface to the private members is too high.

## Different kinds of inheritance and their impact on access
There are 3 ways for classes to inherit from other classes:
1. public
2. protected
3. private

```cpp
// Inherit from Base publicly
class Pub: public Base
{
};

// Inherit from Base protectedly
class Pro: protected Base
{
};

// Inherit from Base privately
class Pri: private Base
{
};

class Def: Base // Defaults to private inheritance
{
};
```

By default, inheritance is private.

Inheritance type is used to change the access specifiers of inherited members in derived classes.

The following rules apply:
- A class can always access its own non-inherited members.
- The public accesses the members of a class based on the access specified of the class being accessed.
- A derived class accesses inherited members based on the access specifier inherited from the parent. The inherited access specifier varies depending on the type of inheritance used.

## Public inheritance
| Access specifier in base class | Access specifier when inherited publicly |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Public                         | Public                                   |
| Protected                      | Protected                                |
| Private                        | Inaccessible                             |

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
    int m_public {};
protected:
    int m_protected {};
private:
    int m_private {};
};

class Pub: public Base // note: public inheritance
{
    // Public inheritance means:
    // Public inherited members stay public (so m_public is treated as public)
    // Protected inherited members stay protected (so m_protected is treated as protected)
    // Private inherited members stay inaccessible (so m_private is inaccessible)
public:
    Pub()
    {
        m_public = 1; // okay: m_public was inherited as public
        m_protected = 2; // okay: m_protected was inherited as protected
        m_private = 3; // not okay: m_private is inaccessible from derived class
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Outside access uses the access specifiers of the class being accessed.
    Base base;
    base.m_public = 1; // okay: m_public is public in Base
    base.m_protected = 2; // not okay: m_protected is protected in Base
    base.m_private = 3; // not okay: m_private is private in Base

    Pub pub;
    pub.m_public = 1; // okay: m_public is public in Pub
    pub.m_protected = 2; // not okay: m_protected is protected in Pub
    pub.m_private = 3; // not okay: m_private is inaccessible in Pub

    return 0;
}
```

## Protected inheritance
Does not affect the way that the derived class accesses members inherited from its parent. It only affects how outside code can access the members through the derived class.
| Access specifier in base class | Access specifier when inherited publicly |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Public                         | Protected                                |
| Protected                      | Protected                                |
| Private                        | Inaccessible                             |

## Private inheritance
Does not affect the way that the derived class accesses members inherited from its parent. It only affects how outside code can access the members through the derived class.

    int m_public {};

    int m_protected {};
private:
    int m_private {};
};

class Pri: private Base // note: private inheritance

    // Protected inherited members become private (so m_protected is treated as private)
    // Private inherited members stay inaccessible (so m_private is inaccessible)
public:
    Pri()
    {
        m_public = 1; // okay: m_public is now private in Pri
        m_protected = 2; // okay: m_protected is now private in Pri
        m_private = 3; // not okay: derived classes can't access private members in the base class
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Outside access uses the access specifiers of the class being accessed.
    // In this case, the access specifiers of base.
    Base base;
    base.m_public = 1; // okay: m_public is public in Base
    base.m_protected = 2; // not okay: m_protected is protected in Base
    base.m_private = 3; // not okay: m_private is private in Base

    Pri pri;
    pri.m_public = 1; // not okay: m_public is now private in Pri
    pri.m_protected = 2; // not okay: m_protected is now private in Pri
    pri.m_private = 3; // not okay: m_private is inaccessible in Pri

    return 0;
}
```

# Final example
```cpp
class Base
{
public:
	int m_public {};
protected:
	int m_protected {};
private:
	int m_private {};
};
```

```cpp
class D2 : private Base // note: private inheritance
{
	// Private inheritance means:
	// Public inherited members become private
	// Protected inherited members become private
	// Private inherited members stay inaccessible
public:
	int m_public2 {};
protected:
	int m_protected2 {};
private:
	int m_private2 {};
};
```

```cpp
class D3 : public D2
{
	// Public inheritance means:
	// Public inherited members stay public
	// Protected inherited members stay protected
	// Private inherited members stay inaccessible

	//Cannot access m_protected or m_public because set to private in D2
public:
	int m_public3 {};
protected:
	int m_protected3 {};
private:
	int m_private3 {};
};
```
