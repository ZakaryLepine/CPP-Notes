When a derived class object is instantiated:
- Memory for the derived class is set asied (enough for the derived class and base classes)
- The appropriate derived class constructor is called.
- The base class object is constructed using the appropriate base class constructor. If no base class constructor is specified, the default base class constructor is used.
- The member initializer list initializes variables.
- The body of the constructor executes.
- Control is returned to the caller.

## Initializing base class members
C++ prevents derived classes from initializing inherited members in the member initializer list of the derived classe's constructor. The value of a member variable can only be set in a member initializer list of a constructor belonging to the same class as the variable.

Since const and reference variables must be initialized with a value at the time of creation, the base class constructor must set const and reference variable values when the variable is created. 

Inherited variables can have their values changed in the body of a derived classe's constructor using assignment.

```cpp
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    double m_cost {};

    Derived(double cost=0.0, int id=0)
        : m_cost{ cost }
    {
        m_id = id;
    }

    double getCost() const { return m_cost; }
};
```

To initialize base class member variables, invoke a base class constructor in the member initializer list.
```cpp
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    double m_cost {};

    Derived(double cost=0.0, int id=0)
        : Base{ id } // Call Base(int) constructor with value id!
        , m_cost{ cost }
    {
    }

    double getCost() const { return m_cost; }
};
```

When a derived class object is instantiated:
1.  Memory for the derived class object is allocated.
2.  The derived class's constructor is called.
3.  The compiler looks to see if a particular base class constructor. We have! 
4.  The base class's constructor member initializer list initializes its specified member variables.
5.  The base class's constructor body executes.
6.  The base class's constructor returns.
7.  The derived class's constructor member initializer list initializes specified member variables.
8.  The derived class's constructor body executes.
9.  The derived class's constructor returns.

## Inheritance chains
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
public:
    A(int a)
    {
        std::cout << "A: " << a << '\n';
    }
};

class B: public A
{
public:
    B(int a, double b)
    : A{ a }
    {
        std::cout << "B: " << b << '\n';
    }
};

class C: public B
{
public:
    C(int a, double b, char c)
    : B{ a, b }
    {
        std::cout << "C: " << c << '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    C c{ 5, 4.3, 'R' };

    return 0;
}
```

```
A: 5
B: 4.3
C: R
```

## Destructors
When a derived clas is destroyed, each destructor is called in the reverse order of construction.

### Question 1
#### Question
1.  Letâ€™s implement our Fruit example that we talked about in our introduction to inheritance. Create a Fruit base class that contains two private members: a name (std::string), and a color (std::string). Create an Apple class that inherits Fruit. Apple should have an additional private member: fiber (double). Create a Banana class that also inherits Fruit. Banana has no additional members.

The following program should run:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	const Apple a{ "Red delicious", "red", 4.2 };
	std::cout << a << '\n';

	const Banana b{ "Cavendish", "yellow" };
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```
And print the following:
```
Apple(Red delicious, red, 4.2)
Banana(Cavendish, yellow)
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Fruit
{
private:
	std::string m_name {};
	std::string m_color {};

public:
	Fruit(const std::string& name, const std::string& color)
		: m_name { name }, m_color { color }
	{
	}

	const std::string& getName() const { return m_name };
	const std::string& getColor() const { return m_color };
};

class Apple : public Fruit
{
private: 
	double m_fiber {};

public:
	Apple(const std::string& name, const std::string& color, double fiber)
		: Fruit { name, color }, m_fiber { fiber }
	{
	}

	double getFiber() const { return m_fiber };
}

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Apple& apple)
{
	out << "Apple(" << a.getName() << ", " << a.getColor() << ", " << a.getFiber() << ')';
	return out;
}


class Banana : public Fruit
{
public:
	Banana(const std::string& name, const std::string& color)
		:Fruit{ name, color }
	{
	}
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Banana& b)
{
	out << "Banana(" << b.getName() << ", " << b.getColor() << ')';
	return out;
}

int main()
{
	const Apple a{ "Red delicious", "red", 4.2 };
	std::cout << a << '\n';

	const Banana b{ "Cavendish", "yellow" };
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	return 0;
}

```
