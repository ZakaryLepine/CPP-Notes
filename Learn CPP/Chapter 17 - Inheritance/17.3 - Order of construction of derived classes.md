When C++ constructs derived objects, the derived objects are constructed in phases.

The most-base class is constructed first.

Each child clas is constructed in order until the most-child class is constructed last.

Instantiating the base class first ensures that variables and functions from the base class are already initialized by the time a derived class is created which allows derived classes to use variables and behaviors of its base classes.

## Order of construction for inheritance chains
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
public:
    A()
    {
        std::cout << "A\n";
    }
};

class B: public A
{
public:
    B()
    {
        std::cout << "B\n";
    }
};

class C: public B
{
public:
    C()
    {
        std::cout << "C\n";
    }
};

class D: public C
{
public:
    D()
    {
        std::cout << "D\n";
    }
};
```

```
