## Adding new functionality to a derived class
There are times when a programmer has access to a base class but does not want to modify the base class. For example, a programmer purchases a library from a 3rd part vendor and wants to add functionalities to the library. The functionalities could be added to the library but could become overwritten when the vendor pushes an update for the library.

There are times when a programmers does not have access to a base but wants to add functionalities to the base class. For example, a programmer may want to add functionalities to a standard library base class.

In these cases, the best way to add functionalities is to create a class that inherits from the base class and add the new functionalities in the derived class.
