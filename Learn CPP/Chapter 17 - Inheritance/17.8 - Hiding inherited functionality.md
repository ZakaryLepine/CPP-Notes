## Changing an inherited member's access level
Can change an inherited member's access specifier in the derived class by using a *using declaration* to identify the scoped base class member that is having its access changed under the new access specifier.

Can only change the access specifiers of base members that the derived class normally has access to. Therefore, can never change the access specifier of a base member from private to protected/public.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
private:
    int m_value {};

public:
    Base(int value)
        : m_value { value }
    {
    }

protected:
    void printValue() const { std::cout << m_value; }
};



class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived(int value)
        : Base { value }
    {
    }

    // Base::printValue was inherited as protected, so the public has no access
    // But we're changing it to public via a using declaration
    using Base::printValue; // note: no parenthesis here
};


int main()
{
    Derived derived { 7 };

    // printValue is public in Derived, so this is okay
    derived.printValue(); // prints 7
    return 0;
}
```

## Hiding functionality
A derived class can hide functionality that exists in the base class so that the functionality cannot be accessed through the derived class by changing the access specifier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	int m_value{};
};

class Derived : public Base
{
private:
	using Base::m_value;

public:
	Derived(int value) : Base { value }
	{
	}
};

int main()
{
	Derived derived{ 7 };
	std::cout << derived.m_value; // error: m_value is private in Derived

	Base& base{ static_cast<Base&>(derived) };
	std::cout << base.m_value; // okay: m_value is public in Base

	return 0;
}
```

Can mark member functions as deleted in the derived class to hide the functionality in the derived class.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
private:
	int m_value {};

public:
	Base(int value)
		: m_value { value }
	{
	}

	int getValue() const { return m_value; }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	Derived(int value)
		: Base { value }
	{
	}


	int getValue() const = delete; // mark this function as inaccessible
};

int main()
{
	Derived derived { 7 };

	// The following won't work because getValue() has been deleted!
	std::cout << derived.getValue();

	return 0;
}
```

The functionality can still be used when the derived class is casted to the base class.
```cpp
int main()
{
	Derived derived { 7 };

	// We can call the Base::getValue() function directly
	std::cout << derived.Base::getValue();

	// Or we can upcast Derived to a Base reference and getValue() will resolve to Base::getValue()
	std::cout << static_cast<Base&>(derived).getValue();

	return 0;
}
```
