There are cases where the user wants to catch an exception but not fully handle it at the point where the exception is caught.

## Throwing a new exception
The exception thrown from a catch block does not need to be the same type as the type of the exception that was just caught.

```cpp
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database* d, std::string table, std::string key)
{
    assert(d);

    try
    {
        return d->getIntValue(table, key); // throws int exception on failure
    }
    catch (int exception)
    {
        // Write an error to some global logfile
        g_log.logError("getIntValueFromDatabase failed");

        throw 'q'; // throw char exception 'q' up the stack to be handled by caller of getIntValueFromDatabase()
    }
}
```

## Rethrowing an exception
Can rethrow the exact same exception as the one that was just caught. Use the *throw* keyword from within the catch block with no associated variable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Base
{
public:
    Base() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
};

class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {}
    void print() override { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};

int main()
{
    try
    {
        try
        {
            throw Derived{};
        }
        catch (Base& b)
        {
            std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
            b.print();
            std::cout << '\n';
            throw; // note: We're now rethrowing the object here
        }
    }
    catch (Base& b)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
        b.print();
        std::cout << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
```
