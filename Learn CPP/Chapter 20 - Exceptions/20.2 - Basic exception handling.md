Exceptions are implemented using 3 keywrods that work in conjunction with each other:
1. *throw*
2. *try*
3. *catch*

## Throwing exceptions
A **throw statement** is used to signal that an exception or error case has occured.

Signaling that an exception has occurred is called **raising** an exception.

To use a throw statement, use the *throw* keyword followed by a value of any data type to use to signal that an error has occurred.

```cpp
throw -1; // throw a literal integer value
throw ENUM_INVALID_INDEX; // throw an enum value
throw "Can not take square root of negative number"; // throw a literal C-style (const char*) string
throw dX; // throw a double variable that was previously defined
throw MyException("Fatal Error"); // Throw an object of class MyException
```

## Looking for exceptions
Use the *try* keyword to define a block of statements (try block). 

The try block acts as observer. The try blocks looks for any exceptions that are thrown by any of the statements within the try block.

```CPP
try
{
    // Statements that may throw exceptions you want to handle go here
    throw -1; // here's a trivial throw statement
}
```

## Handling exceptions
Use the *catch* keyword to define a block of code (catch block) that handles exceptions for a single data type.

```cpp
catch (int x)
{
    // Handle an exception of type int here
    std::cerr << "We caught an int exception with value" << x << '\n';
}
```

Catch parameters work like function parameters.

Exceptions of fundamental types can be caught by value.

Exceptions of non-fundamental types should be caught by const reference to avoid making unnecessary copies.

Type conversion is not done for catch parameters.

## Putting throw, try, and catch together
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    try
    {
        // Statements that may throw exceptions you want to handle go here
        throw -1; // here's a trivial example
    }
    catch (int x)
    {
        // Any exceptions of type int thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an int exception with value: " << x << '\n';
    }
    catch (double) // no variable name since we don't use the exception itself in the catch block below
    {
        // Any exceptions of type double thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an exception of type double" << '\n';
    }
    catch (const std::string&) // catch classes by const reference
    {
        // Any exceptions of type std::string thrown within the above try block get sent here
        std::cerr << "We caught an exception of type std::string" << '\n';
    }

    std::cout << "Continuing on our merry way\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```
We caught an int exception with value -1
Continuing on our merry way
```

## Recapping exception handling
When an exception is raised (using *throw*), execution of the program immediately jumps to the nearst enclosing *try* block (propagating up the stack if necessary to find an enclosing try block). If any of the *catch* handlers attached to the try block handle that type of exception, that handler is executed and the exception is considered handled.

If no appropriate catch handlers exist, execution of the program propagates to the next enclosing try block. If no appropriate catch handlers can be found before the end of the program, the program will fail with an exception error.

The compiler does not perform implicit conversions or promotions when matching exceptions with catch blocks. Casts from a derived class to one of its parent classes will be performed.

## Exceptions are handled immediately
When an exception is raised, execution immediately moves to the nearest enclosing try block.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    try
    {
        throw 4.5; // throw exception of type double
        std::cout << "This never prints\n";
    }
    catch (double x) // handle exception of type double
    {
        std::cerr << "We caught a double of value: " << x << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```
We caught a double of value: 4.5
```

```cpp
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    double x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    try // Look for exceptions that occur within try block and route to attached catch block(s)
    {
        // If the user entered a negative number, this is an error condition
        if (x < 0.0)
            throw "Can not take sqrt of negative number"; // throw exception of type const char*

        // Otherwise, print the answer
        std::cout << "The sqrt of " << x << " is " << std::sqrt(x) << '\n';
    }
    catch (const char* exception) // catch exceptions of type const char*
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << exception << '\n';
    }
}
```

```
Enter a number: 9
The sqrt of 9 is 3
```

```
Enter a number: -4
Error: Can not take sqrt of negative number
```

## What catch blocks typically do
Exceptions are considered handled when a matching exception handler is found.

There are 4 typical things that catch blocks do:
1. Print an error and allow the function to proceed.
2. Return a value or error code to the caller.
3. Throw another exception.
4. Catch fatal errors and terminate the program in a clean way.
