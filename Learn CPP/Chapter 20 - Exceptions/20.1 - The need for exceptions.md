## When return codes fail
When writing reusable code, error handling is a necessity.

A common way to handle potential errors is via return codes.
```cpp
#include <string_view>

int findFirstChar(std::string_view string, char ch)
{
    // Step through each character in string
    for (std::size_t index{ 0 }; index < string.length(); ++index)
        // If the character matches ch, return its index
        if (string[index] == ch)
            return index;

    // If no match was found, return -1
    return -1;
}
```

Return codes have drawbacks:
- Return values of return codes are cryptic.
- Functions can only return 1 value.
- Error codes must be checked constantly in sequences of code prone to many errors.
- Return codes do not mix with constructors.
- A caller may not be equipped to handle an error code.

Error codes are intricately linked to the normal code flow.

## Exceptions
Exception handling provides a mechanism to decouple handling of errors from the typical control flow of the code. 

Exception handling allows more freedom to handle errors when and how every is most useful for a given situation.
