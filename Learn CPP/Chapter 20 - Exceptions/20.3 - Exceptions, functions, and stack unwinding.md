## Throwing exceptions from called functions
Do try blocks detect exceptions thrown by a function that is called from within try blocks? Yes.

The throw statements do not have to be placed directly inside a try block. 

Exceptions can be thrown from anywhere in a function and the exceptions can be caught by the try block of the  caller. When an exception is caught by a try block of the caller, execution jumps from the point where the exception is thrown to the catch block handling the exception.

The advantage of not letting a function handle its own exceptions is that each application can handle the error in a context appropriate manner and the function remains modular.
```cpp
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function
#include <iostream>

// A modular square root function
double mySqrt(double x)
{
    // If the user entered a negative number, this is an error condition
    if (x < 0.0)
        throw "Can not take sqrt of negative number"; // throw exception of type const char*

    return std::sqrt(x);
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    double x {};
    std::cin >> x;

    try // Look for exceptions that occur within try block and route to attached catch block(s)
    {
        double d = mySqrt(x);
        std::cout << "The sqrt of " << x << " is " << d << '\n';
    }
    catch (const char* exception) // catch exceptions of type const char*
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << exception << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Exception handling and stack unwinding
When an exception is thrown, the program looks to see if the exception can be handled immediately inside the current function. If the current function can handle the exception, the function does so.

If the function cannot handle the exception, the program checks whether the function's caller can handle the exception. If no match is found, the caller's caller is checked. 

The process of checking each function up the call stack continues until either a handler is found, or all of the functions on the call stack have been checked and no handler can be found.

If a matching exception handler is found, execution jumps from the point where the exception is thrown to the top of the matching catch block. Moving to the matching catch block requires unwinding the stack (removing the current function from the call stack) as many times as necessary to make the function handling the exception the top function on the call stack.

When the current function is removed from the call stack, all local variabels are destroyed but no value is returned.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void D() // called by C()
{
    std::cout << "Start D\n";
    std::cout << "D throwing int exception\n";

    throw - 1;

    std::cout << "End D\n"; // skipped over
}

void C() // called by B()
{
    std::cout << "Start C\n";
    D();
    std::cout << "End C\n";
}

void B() // called by A()
{
    std::cout << "Start B\n";

    try
    {
        C();
    }
    catch (double) // not caught: exception type mismatch
    {
        std::cerr << "B caught double exception\n";
    }

    try
    {
    }
    catch (int) // not caught: exception not thrown within try
    {
        std::cerr << "B caught int exception\n";
    }

    std::cout << "End B\n";
}

void A() // called by main()
{
    std::cout << "Start A\n";

    try
    {
        B();
    }
    catch (int) // exception caught here and handled
    {
        std::cerr << "A caught int exception\n";
    }

    std::cout << "End A\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Start main\n";

    try
    {
        A();
    }
    catch (int) // not called because exception was handled by A
    {
        std::cerr << "main caught int exception\n";
    }
    std::cout << "End main\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```
Start main
Start A
Start B
Start C
Start D
D throwing int exception
A caught int exception
End A
End main
```
