## Function try blocks
**Function try blocks** are designed to allow the user to establish an exception handler around the body of an entire function rather than around a block of code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
private:
	int m_x;
public:
	A(int x) : m_x{x}
	{
		if (x <= 0)
			throw 1; // Exception thrown here
	}
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	B(int x) try : A{x} // note addition of try keyword here
	{
	}
	catch (...) // note this is at same level of indentation as the function itself
	{
                // Exceptions from member initializer list or constructor body are caught here

                std::cerr << "Exception caught\n";

                throw; // rethrow the existing exception
	}
};

int main()
{
	try
	{
		B b{0};
	}
	catch (int)
	{
		std::cout << "Oops\n";
	}
}
```

```
Exception caught
Oops
```

## Limitations on function catch blocks
A function-level catch block for a constructor must:
- throw a new exception.
- rethrow the existing exception.

Function-level catch blocks for a constructor cannot resolve exceptions. Reaching the end of the function-level catch block implicitly rethrows the exception. Function-level catch blocks for a constructor cannot return a value.

A function-level catch for a destructor can:
- throw a new exception.
- rethrow the existing exception.
- resolve the current exception via a return statement.

Reaching the end of the function-level catch block of a destructor implicitly rethrows the exception.

A function-level catch block for non-value returning functions can:
- throw a new exception.
- rethrow the existing exception.
- resolve the current exception via a return statement.

Reaching the end of a function-level catch block for a non-value returning function will implicitly resolve the exception.

Reaching the end of a function-level catch block for a value returning function produces undefined behavior.

| Function type                | Can resolve exceptions via return statement | Behavior at end of catch block |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Constructor                  | No, must throw or rethrow                   | Implicit rethrow               |
| Destructor                   | Yes                                         | Implicit rethrow               |
| Non-value returning function | Yes                                         | Resolve exception              |
| Value-returning function     | Yes                                         | Undefined behavior             |

Function-level catch blocks are almost exclusively used with constructors.

## Function try blocks can catch both base and the current class exceptions
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
private:
	int m_x;
public:
	A(int x) : m_x{x}
	{
	}
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	B(int x) try : A{x} // note addition of try keyword here
	{
		if (x <= 0) // moved this from A to B
			throw 1; // and this too
	}
	catch (...)
	{
                std::cerr << "Exception caught\n";

                // If an exception isn't explicitly thrown here, the current exception will be implicitly rethrown
	}
};

int main()
{
	try
	{
		B b{0};
	}
	catch (int)
	{
		std::cout << "Oops\n";
	}
}
```

```
Exception caught
Oops
```

## Do not use function try to clean up resources
When construction of an object fails, the destructor of the class is not called.

Referring to members of the failed object is considered undefined behavior since the object is "dead" before the constructor's catch block can execute. 

Function try is primarily used to log failures or to change the type of exception thrown.
