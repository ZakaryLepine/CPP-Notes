## Member selection for structs and references to structs
The *member selection operator (.)* can select members from a struct reference.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& e)
{
    // Use member selection opeartor (.) to select member from reference to struct
    std::cout << "Id: " << e.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "  Age: " << e.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "  Wage: " << e.wage << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    printEmployee(joe);

    return 0;
}
```

## Member selection for pointers to structs
The *member selection operator (.)* does not work with pointers to structs.

To use the *member selection operator (.)*, the pointer must be dereferenced before the object's member(s) can be accessed. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    Employee* ptr{ &joe };
    std::cout << (*ptr).id << '\n'; // Not great but works: First dereference ptr, then use member selection

    return 0;
}
```

**Member Selection From Pointer Operator (->):** Used to select members from a pointer to an object. 

The member selection from pointer operator (->) implicitly dereferences the pointer object before selecting the member.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    Employee* ptr{ &joe };
    std::cout << ptr->id << '\n'; // Better: use -> to select member from pointer to object

    return 0;
}
```

## Mixing pointers and non-pointers to members
The member selection operator is always applied to the currently selected variable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Paw
{
    int claws{};
};

struct Animal
{
    std::string name{};
    Paw paw{};
};

int main()
{
    Animal puma{ "Puma", { 5 } };

    Animal* ptr{ &puma };

    // ptr is a pointer, use ->
    // paw is not a pointer, use .

    std::cout << (ptr->paw).claws << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
