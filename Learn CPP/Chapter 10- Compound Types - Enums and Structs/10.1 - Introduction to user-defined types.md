## What are user-defined types
**User-Defined Types:** Custom types that can be used in programs. 

C++ has two categories of user-defined types:
1. Enumerated types
	1. Unscoped enumerations
	2. Scoped enumerations
2. Class types
	1. Structs
	2. Classes 
	3. Unions

## Defining program-defined types
**Type Definition:** Definition of a program-defined type. 

Program-defined types must always end with a semicolon.

## Naming program-defined types
Name your program-defined types starting with a capital letter and do not use a suffix.

## Using program-defined types in a multi-file program
Every code file that uses a user-defined type must see the full type definition before it is used. 

A program-defined type used in only one code file should be defined in the code file as close to the first point of use as possible.

A program-defined type used in multiple code files should be defined in a header file with the same name as the program-defined types.

## Type definitions are partially exempt from the one-definition rule
A user-defined type is allowed to be defined in multiple code files.

Only one type definition is allowed per code file.

All type definitions for a user-defined type must be identical. 

## User-defined types vs program-defined types
| Type            | Meaning                                            | Examples              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Fundamental     | Type built into the core C++ language              | int, std::nullptr_t   |
| User-defined    | Non-fundamental type                               | std::string, Fraction |
| Program-defined | Class type or enumeration type defined by the user | Fraction              |
