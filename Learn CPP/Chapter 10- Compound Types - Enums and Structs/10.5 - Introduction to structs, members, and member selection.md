**Struct (Structure):** Program-defined data type that allows the user to bundle multiple variables together into a single type.

## Defining structs
Before using a struct, the user must give the compiler a struct definition.
```cpp
struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};
```

**Data Member (Member Variable):** Variables that are part of the struct/class.

## Defining struct objects
```cpp
Employee joe; // Employee is the type, joe is the variable name
```

## Accessing members
**Member Selection Operator (operator .):** Used to access a specific member variable.
