## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

Each individual monster should also have a name (use a `std::string` or `std::string_view`), as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the struct’s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

Your program should produce the following output:
```
This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

struct Monster 
{
	enum class MonsterType
	{
		ogre,
		dragon,
		orc,
		giantSpider,
		slime,
	};

	MonsterType type {};
	std::string_view name {};
	int health { 0 };
};

void printMonster(const Monster& monster)
{
	std::cout << "This " << getMonsterTypeString(monster.type) << " is named " << monster.name << " and has " << monster.health << " health.";
};

constexpr std::string_view getMonsterTypeString(MonsterType type)
{
	switch (type)
	{
	case MonsterType::ogre:          return "Ogre";
	case MonsterType::dragon:        return "Dragon";
	case MonsterType::orc:           return "Orc";
	case MonsterType::giant_spider:  return "Giant Spider";
	case MonsterType::slime:         return "Slime";
	}

	return "Unknown";
}

int main() 
{
	Monster ogre { .type {MonsterType::ogre}, .name { "Torg" }, .health {145} };
	Monster slime { .type {MonsterType::slime}, .name { "Blurp" }, .health {23} };

	printMonster(ogre);
	printMonster(slime);

	return 0;
};
```
### Question 2
#### Question
Specify whether objects of each of the given types should be passed by value, const address, or const reference. You can assume the function that takes these types as parameters doesn’t modify them.
a) char
b) std::string
c) unsigned long
d) bool
e) An enumerated type
f)
```cpp
struct Position
{
  double x{};
  double y{};
  double z{};
}
```
g) 
```cpp
struct Player
{
  int health{};
  // The Player struct is still under development.  More members will be added.
};
```

h) An object whose address is held in an int*;
i) std::string_view
#### Answer
a) value
b) const reference
c) value
d) value
e) value
f) const reference
g) const reference
h) const address
i) value

### Question 3
#### Question
Create a class template named `Triad` that has 3 members of the same template type. The following program should compile:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Triad t1{ 1, 2, 3 }; // note: uses CTAD to deduce template arguments
	print(t1);

	Triad t2{ 1.2, 3.4, 5.6 }; // note: uses CTAD to deduce template arguments
	print(t2);

	return 0;
}
```
and produce the following result:
```
[1, 2, 3][1.2, 3.4, 5.6]
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct Triad
{
	T first {};
	T second {};
	T third{};
};

template <typename T>
Triad(T, T, T) -> Triad<T>


template <typename T>
void print(const Triad<T>& t)
{
	std::cout << '[' << t.first << ", " << t.second << ", " << t.third << ']';
}

int main()
{
	Triad t1{ 1, 2, 3 };
	print(t1);

	Triad t2{ 1.2, 3.4, 5.6 };
	print(t2);

	return 0;
}
```
