## Passing structs by reference
Can pass an entire struct to a function that needs to work with the struct's members.

Structs are generally passed by const reference to avoid creating copies.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& employee) // note pass by reference here
{
    std::cout << "ID:   " << employee.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "Age:  " << employee.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "Wage: " << employee.wage << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Employee joe { 14, 32, 24.15 };
    Employee frank { 15, 28, 18.27 };

    // Print Joe's information
    printEmployee(joe);

    std::cout << '\n';

    // Print Frank's information
    printEmployee(frank);

    return 0;
}
```

## Returning structs
Structs are generally returned by value to avoid dangling references.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Point3d
{
    double x { 0.0 };
    double y { 0.0 };
    double z { 0.0 };
};

Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    // We can create a variable and return the variable (we'll improve this below)
    Point3d temp { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
    return temp;
}

int main()
{
    Point3d zero{ getZeroPoint() };

    if (zero.x == 0.0 && zero.y == 0.0 && zero.z == 0.0)
        std::cout << "The point is zero\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The point is not zero\n";

    return 0;
}
```

## Returning unnamed structs
```cpp
Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    return Point3d { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // return an unnamed Point3d
}
```
```cpp
Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    // We already specified the type at the function declaration
    // so we don't need to do so here again
    return { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // return an unnamed Point3d
}
```

## Structs with program-defined members
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age {};
    double wage {};
};

struct Company
{
    int numberOfEmployees {};
    Employee CEO {}; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
};

int main()
{
    Company myCompany{ 7, { 1, 32, 55000.0 } }; // Nested initialization list to initialize Employee
    std::cout << myCompany.CEO.wage; // print the CEO's wage
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Company
{
    struct Employee // accessed via Company::Employee
    {
        int id{};
        int age{};
        double wage{};
    };

    int numberOfEmployees{};
    Employee CEO{}; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
};

int main()
{
    Company myCompany{ 7, { 1, 32, 55000.0 } }; // Nested initialization list to initialize Employee
    std::cout << myCompany.CEO.wage; // print the CEO's wage
}
```

## Struct size and data structure alignment
The size of a struct is atleast the sum of the size of all its members.

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
You are running a website, and you are trying to keep track of how much money you make per day from advertising. Declare an advertising struct that keeps track of how many ads you’ve shown to readers, what percentage of ads were clicked on by users, and how much you earned on average from each ad that was clicked. Read in values for each of these fields from the user. Pass the advertising struct to a function that prints each of the values, and then calculates how much you made for that day (multiply all 3 fields together).
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Advertisting
{
	int numberOfAdsShow {};
	double clickThroughRatePercentage {};
    double averageEarningsPerClick {};
};


void printAdvertising(const Advertising& ad)
{
    std::cout << "Number of ads shown: " << ad.adsShown << '\n';
    std::cout << "Click through rate: " << ad.clickThroughRatePercentage << '\n';
    std::cout << "Average earnings per click: $" << ad.averageEarningsPerClick << '\n';

    // The following line is split up to reduce the length
    // We need to divide ad.clickThroughRatePercentage by 100 because it's a percent of 100, not a multiplier
    std::cout << "Total Earnings: $" <<
        (ad.adsShown * ad.clickThroughRatePercentage / 100 * ad.averageEarningsPerClick) << '\n';
}


int main()
{
    // Declare an Advertising struct variable
    Advertising ad{ .numberOfAdsShown {0}, .clickThroughRatePercentage { 10 }, .averageEarningsPerClick {5}   };
    printAdvertising(ad);

    return 0;
}

```
### Question 2
#### Question
Create a struct to hold a fraction. The struct should have an integer numerator and an integer denominator member.

Write a function to read in a Fraction from the user, and use it to read-in two fraction objects. Write another function to multiply two Fractions together and return the result as a Fraction (you don’t need to reduce the fraction). Write another function that prints a fraction.

Your program’s output should match the following:
```
Enter a value for the numerator: 1
Enter a value for the denominator: 2

Enter a value for the numerator: 3
Enter a value for the denominator: 4

Your fractions multiplied together: 3/8
```
When multiplying two fractions together, the resulting numerator is the product of the two numerators, and the resulting denominator is the product of the two denominators.
#### Answer
```cpp
struct Fraction
{
	int numerator { 0 };
	int denominator { 1 };
};

Fraction getFraction()
{
    Fraction temp{};
    std::cout << "Enter a value for numerator: ";
    std::cin >> temp.numerator;
    std::cout << "Enter a value for denominator: ";
    std::cin >> temp.denominator;
    std::cout << '\n';
    return temp;
}

Fraction multiply(const Fraction& f1, const Fraction& f2)
{
    return { f1.numerator * f2.numerator, f1.denominator * f2.denominator };
}

void printFraction(const Fraction& f)
{
    std::cout << f.numerator << '/' << f.denominator;
}

int main()
{
    // Allocate our first fraction
    Fraction f1{ getFraction() };
    Fraction f2{ getFraction() };

    std::cout << "Your fractions multiplied together: ";

    printFraction(multiply(f1, f2));

    return 0;
}

```
### Question 3
#### Question
In the solution to the prior quiz question, why does `getFraction()` return by value instead of by reference?
#### Answer
getFraction() returns by value because, if we were to return by reference, the reference would be a dangling reference as the struct would go out of scope and out of lifetime.
