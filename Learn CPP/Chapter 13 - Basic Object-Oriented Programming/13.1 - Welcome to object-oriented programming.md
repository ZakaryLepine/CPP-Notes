In procedural programming, programs are lists of instructions to the computer that define data (via objects) and work with the data (via statements and functions). The data and the functions that operate on the data are separate entities that are combined together to produce the desired result. 
```cpp
driveTo(you, work);
```

Object-oriented programming (OOP) provides the user with the ability to create objects that tie together both properties and behaviors into a self-contained, reusable package. 
```cpp
you.driveTo(work);
```

In procedural programming, the focus is on defining functions that operate on data. In object-oriented programming, the focus is on defining objects that have a set of behaviors.

Object-oriented programming allows programs to be more modular which allows more code-reusability.
