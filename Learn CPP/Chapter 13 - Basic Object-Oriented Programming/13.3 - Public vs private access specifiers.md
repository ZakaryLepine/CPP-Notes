## Public and private members
**Public members** are members of a struct/class that can be accessed directly by anyone, including code outside the struct/class.
**Private members** are members of a struct/class that cannot be accessed outisde the struct/class (outisde the public).

## Access Specifiers
**Access specifiers** determine who has access to the members that follow them.

There are 3 access specifier keywords:
1. public
2. private
3. protected

## Mixing access specifiers 
A struct/class can use multiple access specifiers to set the access levels of each of its members. 

There are no limits to the amount of access specifiers that can be used in a struct/class.

The group of public members of a class are referred to as the struct's/class' **public interface**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DateClass // members are private by default
{
    int m_month {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_day {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
    int m_year {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members

public:
    void setDate(int month, int day, int year) // public, can be accessed by anyone
    {
        // setDate() can access the private members of the class because it is a member of the class itself
        m_month = month;
        m_day = day;
        m_year = year;
    }

    void print() // public, can be accessed by anyone
    {
        std::cout << m_month << '/' << m_day << '/' << m_year;
    }
};

int main()
{
    DateClass date;
    date.setDate(10, 14, 2020); // okay, because setDate() is public
    date.print(); // okay, because print() is public
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Make member variables private and member functions public.

## Access controls work on a per-class basis
Access control works on a per-clas basis, not a per-object basis.

When a function has access to the private members of a class, it can access the private members of any object of that class type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DateClass // members are private by default
{
	int m_month {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
	int m_day {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members
	int m_year {}; // private by default, can only be accessed by other members

public:
	void setDate(int month, int day, int year)
	{
		m_month = month;
		m_day = day;
		m_year = year;
	}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << m_month << '/' << m_day << '/' << m_year;
	}

	// Note the addition of this function
	void copyFrom(const DateClass& d)
	{
		// Note that we can access the private members of d directly
		m_month = d.m_month;
		m_day = d.m_day;
		m_year = d.m_year;
	}
};

int main()
{
	DateClass date;
	date.setDate(10, 14, 2020); // okay, because setDate() is public

	DateClass copy {};
	copy.copyFrom(date); // okay, because copyFrom() is public
	copy.print();
	std::cout << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
a) What is a public member?
b) What is a private member?
c) What is an access specifier?
d) How many access specifiers are there, and what are they?
#### Answer
a) 
A member that is accessible to anyone (within and outside the class)
b) 
A member that is only accessible within the class 
c) 
An access specifier determines who has access to the members that follow the specifier.
d) 
3\. Public, private, protected.
### Question 2
#### Question
a)
Write a simple class named Point3d. The class should contain:

-   Three private member variables of type int named m_x, m_y, and m_z;
-   A public member function named setValues() that allows you to set values for m_x, m_y, and m_z.
-   A public member function named print() that prints the Point in the following format: <m_x, m_y, m_z>

Make sure the following program executes correctly:
```cpp
int main()
{
    Point3d point;
    point.setValues(1, 2, 3);

    point.print();
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
<1, 2, 3>
```
b)
Add a function named isEqual() to your Point3d class. The following code should run correctly:
```cpp
int main()
{
    Point3d point1;
    point1.setValues(1, 2, 3);

    Point3d point2;
    point2.setValues(1, 2, 3);

    if (point1.isEqual(point2))
    {
        std::cout << "point1 and point2 are equal\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "point1 and point2 are not equal\n";
    }

    Point3d point3;
    point3.setValues(3, 4, 5);

    if (point1.isEqual(point3))
    {
        std::cout << "point1 and point3 are equal\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "point1 and point3 are not equal\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Answer
a & b)
```cpp
class Point3D
{
private:
	int m_x{};
	int m_y{};
	int m_z{};
public:
	void setValues(int x, int y, int z)
	{
		m_x = x;
		m_y = y;
		m_z = z;
	}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << "<" << m_x << ", " << m_y << ", " << m_z << ">\n";
	}
	bool isEqual(const Point3D& point)
	{
		return m_x == point.m_x && m_y == point.m_y && m_z == point.m_z;
	}
};
```

### Question 3
#### Question
Now let’s try something a little more complex. Let’s write a class that implements a simple stack from scratch.

The class should be named Stack, and should contain:

-   A private array of integers of length 10.
-   A private integer to keep track of the size of the stack.
-   A public member function named reset() that sets the size to 0.
-   A public member function named push() that pushes a value on the stack. push() should return false if the array is already full, and true otherwise.
-   A public member function named pop() that pops a value off the stack and returns it. If there are no values on the stack, the code should exit via an assert.
-   A public member function named print() that prints all the values in the stack.

Make sure the following program executes correctly:
```cpp
int main()
{
	Stack stack;
	stack.print();

	stack.push(5);
	stack.push(3);
	stack.push(8);
	stack.print();

	stack.pop();
	stack.print();

	stack.pop();
	stack.pop();

	stack.print();

	return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
( )
( 5 3 8 )
( 5 3 )
( )
```
