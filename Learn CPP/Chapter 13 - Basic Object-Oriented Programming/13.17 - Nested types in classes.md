## Nesting types
Types can be defined (nested) inside of another class.

The nested type is defined inside the class under the appropriate access specifier.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Fruit
{
public:
	// Note: we've moved FruitType inside the class, under the public access specifier
	// We've also changed it from an enum class to an enum
	enum FruitType
	{
		apple,
		banana,
		cherry
	};

private:
	FruitType m_type {};
	int m_percentageEaten { 0 };

public:
	Fruit(FruitType type) :
		m_type { type }
	{
	}

	FruitType getType() const { return m_type; }
	int getPercentageEaten() const { return m_percentageEaten; }
};

int main()
{
	// Note: we access the FruitType via Fruit now
	Fruit apple { Fruit::apple };

	if (apple.getType() == Fruit::apple)
		std::cout << "I am an apple";
	else
		std::cout << "I am not an apple";

	return 0;
}
```

Classes essentially act as a namespace for any nested types. 

Since nested classes are members of the outer class, nested classes have access to the members of the outer class.

Nested classes do not have access to the \*this pointer of the enclosing class.

Nested types cannot be forward declared.
