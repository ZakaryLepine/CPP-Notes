Static member functions are not attached to any particular object.

Static member functions can be called directly by using the class name and the scope resolution operator.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Something
{
private:
    static int s_value;
public:
    static int getValue() { return s_value; } // static member function
};

int Something::s_value{ 1 }; // initializer

int main()
{
    std::cout << Something::getValue() << '\n';
}
```

Static member functions can be defined outside the class declaration. When defintion a static member function outside the class declaration, the *static* keyword is not used.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class IDGenerator
{
private:
    static int s_nextID; // Here's the declaration for a static member

public:
     static int getNextID(); // Here's the declaration for a static function
};

// Here's the definition of the static member outside the class.  Note we don't use the static keyword here.
// We'll start generating IDs at 1
int IDGenerator::s_nextID{ 1 };

// Here's the definition of the static function outside of the class.  Note we don't use the static keyword here.
int IDGenerator::getNextID() { return s_nextID++; }

int main()
{
    for (int count{ 0 }; count < 5; ++count)
        std::cout << "The next ID is: " << IDGenerator::getNextID() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Static member functions have no \*this pointer
Since static member functions are not attached to an object, static member functions do not have a \*this pointer.

Static member functions can directly access other static members but not non-static members. 

## A word of warning about classes with all static members
Since static members can only be instantiated once, there cannot be multiple copies of a pure static class. 

Since static members belong the class and class declarations usually have global scope, a pure static class is equivalent to delcaring functions and global variables in a globaaly accessible namespace.

## C++ does not support static constructors
C++ does not support static constructors to initialize static member variables.

If a static variable can be directly initialized, no constructor is needed because the static member variable can be initialized at the point of definition.
```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
	static std::vector<char> s_mychars;
};

std::vector<char> MyClass::s_mychars{ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' }; // initialize static variable at point of definition
```

If initializing a static member variables requires executing code:
- A lamba can be created and called immediately.
```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
    static std::vector<char> s_mychars;
};

std::vector<char> MyClass::s_mychars{
  []{ // The parameter list of lambdas without parameters can be omitted.
      // Inside the lambda we can declare another vector and use a loop.
      std::vector<char> v{};

      for (char ch{ 'a' }; ch <= 'z'; ++ch)
      {
          v.push_back(ch);
      }

      return v;
  }() // Call the lambda right away
};
```
- A nested class can be created, an outer class member can be made of the inner class type, and the inner class constructor can initialize the outer classe's static members.
```cpp
class MyClass
{
public:
	static std::vector<char> s_mychars;

	class init_static // we're defining a nested class named init_static
	{
	public:
		init_static() // the init constructor will initialize our static variable
		{
			for (char ch{ 'a' }; ch <= 'z'; ++ch)
			{
				s_mychars.push_back(ch);
			}
		}
	} ;

private:
	static init_static s_initializer; // we'll use this static object to ensure the init_static constructor is called
};

std::vector<char> MyClass::s_mychars{}; // define our static member variable
MyClass::init_static MyClass::s_initializer{}; // define our static initializer, which will call the init_static constructor, which will initialize s_mychars
```
