## Const classes
Instantiated clas objects can be made const by using the *const* keyword. 
```CPP
const Date date1; // initialize using default constructor
const Date date2(2020, 10, 16); // initialize using parameterized constructor
const Date date3 { 2020, 10, 16 }; // initialize using parameterized constructor (C++11)
```

Any attempt to modify the member variables of a const class object is disallowed. Attempting to modify the member variables include directly modifying member variables and calling member functions that set the value of member variables.
```cpp
class Something
{
public:
    int m_value {};

    Something(): m_value{0} { }

    void setValue(int value) { m_value = value; }
    int getValue() { return m_value ; }
};

int main()
{
    const Something something{}; // calls default constructor

    something.m_value = 5; // compiler error: violates const
    something.setValue(5); // compiler error: violates const

    return 0;
}
```

## Const member functions
A **const member function** is a member functon that guarantees that the member function will not modify the obejct or call non-const member functions.

Const class objects can only call *const* member functions.

The *const* keyword is added after the parameter list.
```cpp
class Something
{
public:
    int m_value {};

    Something(): m_value{0} { }

    void resetValue() { m_value = 0; }
    void setValue(int value) { m_value = value; }

    int getValue() const { return m_value; } // note addition of const keyword after parameter list, but before function body
};
```

For member functions defined outside of the class definition, the const keyword must be used on both the function prototype in the class definition and on the function definition.
```cpp
class Something
{
public:
    int m_value {};

    Something(): m_value{0} { }

    void resetValue() { m_value = 0; }
    void setValue(int value) { m_value = value; }

    int getValue() const; // note addition of const keyword here
};

int Something::getValue() const // and here
{
    return m_value;
}
```

A const member function that attempts to change a member variable or call a non-const member function will cause a compile error.
```cpp
class Something
{
public:
    int m_value {};

    void resetValue() const { m_value = 0; } // compile error, const functions can't change member variables.
};
```

###### Best practice
Make any member function that does not modify the state of the class object const, so that it can be called by const objects.

## Const members can not return non-const references to members
When a member function is const, the hidden this pointer is also const which means that all members are treated as const within that function. 

A const member function can not return a non-const reference to a member because it would allow the caller to have non-const access to the const member.

Const member functions can return const references to members.

## Overloading const and non-const function
A member function can be overloaded to have a const and non-const version.

The const qualifier is considered part of the function signature.

The const version of the function is called on const objects and the non-const version of the function is called on non-const objects.
```cpp
#include <string>

class Something
{
private:
    std::string m_value {};

public:
    Something(const std::string& value=""): m_value{ value } {}

    const std::string& getValue() const { return m_value; } // getValue() for const objects (returns const reference)
    std::string& getValue() { return m_value; } // getValue() for non-const objects (returns non-const reference)
};
```

```cpp
int main()
{
	Something something;
	something.getValue() = "Hi"; // calls non-const getValue();

	const Something something2;
	something2.getValue(); // calls const getValue();

	return 0;
}
```
