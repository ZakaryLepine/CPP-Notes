C++ supports creating C-style string symbolic constants using pointers.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const char* myName{ "Alex" }; // pointer to symbolic constant
    std::cout << myName << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
The compiler usually places the string into read-only memory and sets the pointer to point to the string.

Multiple string literals can be consolidated into a single shared string literal with string literals pointing at the same address.
```cpp
const char* name1{ "Alex" };
const char* name2{ "Alex" };
```
C-style string symbolic constants have *static duration*.

C-style string symbolic constants are used in low-level or old code because they have a small memory footprint.

Modern code should prefer *std::string* and *std::string_view*.

## std::cout and char pointers

When passing an object of type *char\** or *const char \** into *std::cout*, *std::cout* assumes that the user intends to print the string being pointed at.
