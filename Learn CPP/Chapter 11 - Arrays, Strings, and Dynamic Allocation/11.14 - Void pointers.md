**Void Pointer (Generic Pointer):** Special type of pointer that can be pointed at objects of any data type. 

```cpp
void* ptr; // ptr is a void pointer
```

```cpp
int nValue;
float fValue;

struct Something
{
    int n;
    float f;
};

Something sValue;

void* ptr;
ptr = &nValue; // valid
ptr = &fValue; // valid
ptr = &sValue; // valid
```
Dereferencing a void pointer is illegal becuase the void pointer does not know the type of object it is pointing to.

The void pointer must be casted to another pointer type before dereferencing.

Knowing the type that the void pointer is pointing to is the responsibility of the user.

```cpp
int value{ 5 };
void* voidPtr{ &value };

// std::cout << *voidPtr << '\n'; // illegal: dereference of void pointer

int* intPtr{ static_cast<int*>(voidPtr) }; // however, if we cast our void pointer to an int pointer...

std::cout << *intPtr << '\n'; // then we can dereference the result
```

## Void pointer miscellany
Void pointers can be set to a null value.
```cpp
void* ptr{ nullptr }; // ptr is a void pointer that is currently a null pointer
```

Do not delete a void pointer that points to dynamically allocated memory.

Cannot do pointer arithmetic on a void pointer. Pointer arithmetic requires the pointer to know the size of the object it is pointing to.

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
Whatâ€™s the difference between a void pointer and a null pointer?
#### Answer
A void pointer is a pointer that can point to any type of object, but does not know what type of object it points to. A void pointer must be explicitly cast into another type of pointer to perform indirection. A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to an address. A void pointer can be a null pointer.

Thus, a void pointer refers to the type of the pointer, whereas a null pointer refers to the value (address) of the pointer.
