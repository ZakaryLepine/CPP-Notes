When an operator overload does not need to access to the internal (priate or protected) members of a class, an operator overload can be created as normal functions.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Cents
{
private:
  int m_cents{};

public:
  Cents(int cents)
    : m_cents{ cents }
  {}

  int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: this function is not a member function nor a friend function!
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2)
{
  // use the Cents constructor and operator+(int, int)
  // we don't need direct access to private members here
  return Cents{ c1.getCents() + c2.getCents() };
}

int main()
{
  Cents cents1{ 6 };
  Cents cents2{ 8 };
  Cents centsSum{ cents1 + cents2 };
  std::cout << "I have " << centsSum.getCents() << " cents.\n";

  return 0;
}
```

The friend function method declaration is placed inside the class.

The normal function method declaration is placed outside the class.
```cpp
#ifndef CENTS_H
#define CENTS_H

class Cents
{
private:
  int m_cents{};

public:
  Cents(int cents)
    : m_cents{ cents }
  {}

  int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// Need to explicitly provide prototype for operator+ so uses of operator+ in other files know this overload exists
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2);

#endif
```

```cpp
#include "Cents.h"

// note: this function is not a member function nor a friend function!
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2)
{
  // use the Cents constructor and operator+(int, int)
  // we don't need direct access to private members here
  return { c1.getCents() + c2.getCents() };
}
```

###### Best practice
Prefer overloading operators as normal functions instead of friends if it's possible to do so without adding additional functions.
