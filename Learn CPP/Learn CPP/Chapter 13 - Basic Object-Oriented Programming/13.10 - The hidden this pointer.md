C++ utilizes a hidden pointer to keep track of which object a member function is called on.

## The hidden \*this pointer
```cpp
simple.setID(2);
```

```cpp
void setID(int id) { m_id = id; }
```
When compiled, the previous code is converted into the following:
```cpp
setID(&simple, 2); // note that simple has been changed from an object prefix to a function argument!
```

```cpp
void setID(Simple* const this, int id) { this->m_id = id; }
```

When the compiler compiles a non-static member function, the compiler adds a new parameters to the function. The **this pointer** is a hidden const pointer that holds the address of the object that the member function was called on.

## "this" always points to the object being operated on
```CPP
int main()
{
    Simple A{1}; // this = &A inside the Simple constructor
    Simple B{2}; // this = &B inside the Simple constructor
    A.setID(3); // this = &A inside member function setID
    B.setID(4); // this = &B inside member function setID

    return 0;
}
```

The this pointer does not add any memory usage to the class. The this pointer only adds memory usage to the function call. 

## Explicitly referencing "this"
Explicitly referencing this is necessary when a member function has a parameter with the same name as a member variable.
```cpp
class Something
{
private:
    int data;

public:
    Something(int data)
    {
        this->data = data; // this->data is the member, data is the local parameter
    }
};
```

## Chaining member functions
A series of member functions can be chained together by making a class member function return the object it was working with as a return value.
```cpp
class Calc
{
private:
    int m_value{};

public:
    Calc& add(int value) { m_value += value; return *this; }
    Calc& sub(int value) { m_value -= value; return *this; }
    Calc& mult(int value) { m_value *= value; return *this; }

    int getValue() { return m_value; }
};
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Calc calc{};
    calc.add(5).sub(3).mult(4);

    std::cout << calc.getValue() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
