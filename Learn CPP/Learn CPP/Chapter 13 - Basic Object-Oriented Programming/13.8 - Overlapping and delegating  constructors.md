## Delegating constructors 
Constructors are allowed to call other constructors from the same class. The process is called **delegating constructors (constructor chaining)**.

To have a constructor call another constructor, call the constructor in the member initialization list.
```cpp
class Foo
{
private:

public:
    Foo()
    {
        // code to do A
    }

    Foo(int value): Foo{} // use Foo() default constructor to do A
    {
        // code to do B
    }

};
```

A constructor that delgates is not allowed to do any member initialization.


## Using a normal member function for setup
Constructors are allowed to call non-constructor member functions (and non-member functions).
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Foo
{
private:
    const int m_value { 0 };

    void setup() // setup is private so it can only be used by our constructors
    {
        // code to do some common setup tasks (e.g. open a file or database)
        std::cout << "Setting things up...\n";
    }

public:
    Foo()
    {
        setup();
    }

    Foo(int value) : m_value { value } // we must initialize m_value since it's const
    {
        setup();
    }

};

int main()
{
    Foo a;
    Foo b{ 5 };

    return 0;
}
```
