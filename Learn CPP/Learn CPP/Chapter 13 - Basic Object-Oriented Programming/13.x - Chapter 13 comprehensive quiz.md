## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
a)
Write a class named Point2d. Point2d should contain two member variables of type double: m_x, and m_y, both defaulted to 0.0. Provide a constructor and a print function.

The following program should run:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Point2d first{};
    Point2d second{ 3.0, 4.0 };
    first.print();
    second.print();

    return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
Point2d(0, 0)
Point2d(3, 4)
```

b)
Now add a member function named distanceTo that takes another Point2d as a parameter, and calculates the distance between them. Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between them can be calculated as std::sqrt((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)). The std::sqrt function lives in header cmath.

The following program should run:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Point2d first{};
    Point2d second{ 3.0, 4.0 };
    first.print();
    second.print();
    std::cout << "Distance between two points: " << first.distanceTo(second) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
Point2d(0, 0)
Point2d(3, 4)
Distance between two points: 5
```
c)
Change function distanceTo from a member function to a non-member friend function that takes two Points as parameters. Also rename it “distanceFrom”.

The following program should run:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Point2d first{};
    Point2d second{ 3.0, 4.0 };
    first.print();
    second.print();
    std::cout << "Distance between two points: " << distanceFrom(first, second) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
This should print:
```
Point2d(0, 0)
Point2d(3, 4)
Distance between two points: 5
```
#### Answer
a)
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Point2d
{
private:
	double m_x {};
	double m_y {};

public:
	Point2d(x = 0.0, x = 0.0) : m_x { x }, m_y { y }
	{
	}

	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << "Point2d()" << m_x << ", " << m_y << ")\n";
	}
};
```
b)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Point2d
{
private:
	double m_x {};
	double m_y {};

public:
	Point2d(x = 0.0, x = 0.0) : m_x { x }, m_y { y }
	{
	}

	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << "Point2d()" << m_x << ", " << m_y << ")\n";
	}
	
	double distanceTo(const Point2d& point) const
	{

		return std::sqrt((m_x - other.m_x) * (m_x - other.m_x) + (m_y - other.m_y) * (m_y - other.m_y));

	}
};
```
c)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Point2d
{
private:
	double m_x {};
	double m_y {};

public:
	Point2d(x = 0.0, x = 0.0) : m_x { x }, m_y { y }
	{
	}

	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << "Point2d()" << m_x << ", " << m_y << ")\n";
	}

	friend double distanceFrom(const Point2d& point1, const Point2d& point2);
};

double distanceFrom(const Point2d& point1, const Point2d& point2)
	{

		return std::sqrt((point1.m_x - point2.m_x) * (point1.m_x - point2.m_x) + (point1.m_y - point2.m_y) * (point1.m_y - point2.m_y));

	}
```
### Question 2
#### Question
Write a destructor for this class:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class HelloWorld
{
private:
	char* m_data{};

public:
	HelloWorld()
	{
		m_data = new char[14];
		const char* init{ "Hello, World!" };
		for (int i = 0; i < 14; ++i)
			m_data[i] = init[i];
	}

	~HelloWorld()
	{
        // replace this comment with your destructor implementation
	}

	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << m_data << '\n';
	}

};

int main()
{
	HelloWorld hello{};
	hello.print();

    return 0;
}
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class HelloWorld
{
private:
	char* m_data{};

public:
	HelloWorld()
	{
		m_data = new char[14];
		const char* init{ "Hello, World!" };
		for (int i = 0; i < 14; ++i)
			m_data[i] = init[i];
	}

	~HelloWorld()
	{
        delete[] m_data;
	}

	void print() const
	{
		std::cout << m_data << '\n';
	}

};

int main()
{
	HelloWorld hello{};
	hello.print();

    return 0;
}
```
### Question 3
Let’s create a random monster generator. This one should be fun.
a)
First, let’s create an enumeration of monster types named MonsterType. Include the following monster types: Dragon, Goblin, Ogre, Orc, Skeleton, Troll, Vampire, and Zombie. Add an additional max_monster_types enum so we can count how many enumerators there are.

b)
Now, let’s create our Monster class. Our Monster will have 4 attributes (member variables): a type (MonsterType), a name (std::string), a roar (std::string), and the number of hit points (int). Create a Monster class that has these 4 member variables.

c)
enum MonsterType is specific to Monster, so move the enum inside the class as a public declaration. When the enum is inside the class, “MonsterType” can be renamed “Type” since the context is already Monster.

d)
Create a constructor that allows you to initialize all of the member variables.

The following program should compile:
```cpp
int main()
{
	Monster skeleton{ Monster::Type::skeleton, "Bones", "*rattle*", 4 };

	return 0;
}
```

e)
Now we want to be able to print our monster so we can validate it’s correct. To do that, we’re going to need to write a function that converts a Monster::Type into a string. Write that function (called getTypeString()), as well as a print() member function.

The following program should compile:
```cpp
int main()
{
	Monster skeleton{ Monster::Type::skeleton, "Bones", "*rattle*", 4 };
	skeleton.print();

	return 0;
}
```
and print:
```
Bones the skeleton has 4 hit points and says *rattle*
```

g)
Now we can create a random monster generator. Let’s consider how our MonsterGenerator class will work. Ideally, we’ll ask it to give us a Monster, and it will create a random one for us. We don’t need more than one MonsterGenerator. This is a good candidate for a static class (one in which all functions are static). Create a static MonsterGenerator class. Create a static function named generateMonster(). This should return a Monster. For now, make it return anonymous `Monster(Monster::Type::skeleton, "Bones", "*rattle*", 4);`

The following program should compile:
```cpp
int main()
{
	Monster m{ MonsterGenerator::generateMonster() };
	m.print();

	return 0;
}
```
and print:
```
Bones the skeleton has 4 hit points and says *rattle*
```

g)
Now, MonsterGenerator needs to generate some random attributes. To do that, we’ll need to make use of this handy function:
```cpp
// Generate a random number between min and max (inclusive)
// Assumes srand() has already been called
static int getRandomNumber(int min, int max)
{
	static constexpr double fraction{ 1.0 / (static_cast<double>(RAND_MAX) + 1.0) };  // static used for efficiency, so we only calculate this value once
	// evenly distribute the random number across our range
	return static_cast<int>(std::rand() * fraction * (max - min + 1) + min);
}
```

h)
Now edit function generateMonster() to generate a random Monster::Type (between 0 and Monster::Type::max_monster_types-1) and a random hit points (between 1 and 100). This should be fairly straightforward. Once you’ve done that, define two static fixed arrays of size 6 inside the function (named s_names and s_roars) and initialize them with 6 names and 6 sounds of your choice. Pick a random name and roar from these arrays.

The following program should compile:
```cpp
#include <ctime> // for time()
#include <cstdlib> // for rand() and srand()

int main()
{
	std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(nullptr))); // set initial seed value to system clock
	std::rand(); // If using Visual Studio, discard first random value

	Monster m{ MonsterGenerator::generateMonster() };
	m.print();

	return 0;
}
```

i) 
Why did we declare variables s_names and s_roars as static?

### Question 4

Okay, time for that game face again. This one is going to be a challenge. Let’s rewrite the Blackjack game we wrote in a previous lesson using classes! Here’s the full code without classes:

Holy moly! Where do we even begin? Don’t worry, we can do this, but we’ll need a strategy here. This Blackjack program is really composed of four parts: the logic that deals with cards, the logic that deals with the deck of cards, the logic that deals with dealing cards from the deck, and the game logic. Our strategy will be to work on each of these pieces individually, testing each part with a small test program as we go. That way, instead of trying to convert the entire program in one go, we can do it in 4 testable parts.

Start by copying the original program into your IDE, and then commenting out everything except the \#include lines.

a) 
Let’s start by making `Card` a `class` instead of a `struct`. The good news is that the `Card` `class` is pretty similar to the `Monster` `class` from the previous quiz question. First, create private members to hold the rank and suit (name them `m_rank` and `m_suit` accordingly). Second, create a public constructor for the `Card` class so we can initialize Cards. Third, make the `class` default constructible, either by adding a default constructor or by adding default arguments to the current constructor. Fourth, because `CardSuit` and `CardRank` are tied to cards, move those into the `Card` class as standard enums named `Suit` and `Rank`. Finally, move the `printCard()` and `getCardValue()` functions inside the `class` as public members (remember to make them `const`!).
The following test program should compile:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// ...

int main()
{
  const Card cardQueenHearts{ Card::rank_queen, Card::heart };
  cardQueenHearts.print();
  std::cout << " has the value " << cardQueenHearts.value() << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

b)
Okay, now let’s work on a `Deck` `class`. The deck needs to hold 52 cards, so use a private `std::array` member to create a fixed array of 52 cards named `m_deck`. Second, create a constructor that takes no parameters and initializes/assigns m_deck with one of each card (modify the code from the original `createDeck()` function). Third, move `printDeck` into the `Deck` `class` as a public member. Fourth, move `shuffleDeck` into the class as a public member.

The trickiest part of this step is initializing the deck using the modified code from the original `createDeck()` function. The following hint shows how to do that.
The following test program should compile:
```cpp
// ...

int main()
{
  Deck deck{};
  deck.print();
  deck.shuffle();
  deck.print();

  return 0;
}
```

c)
Now we need a way to keep track of which card is next to be dealt (in the original program, this is what `nextCardIndex` was for). First, add a member named `m_cardIndex` to `Deck` and initialize it to 0. Create a public member function named `dealCard()`, which should return a const reference to the current card and advance `m_cardIndex` to the next index. `shuffle()` should also be updated to reset `m_cardIndex` (since if you shuffle the deck, you’ll start dealing from the top of the deck again).

The following test program should compile:
```cpp
// ...

int main()
{
  Deck deck{};

  deck.shuffle();
  deck.print();

  std::cout << "The first card has value: " << deck.dealCard().value() << '\n';
  std::cout << "The second card has value: " << deck.dealCard().value() << '\n';

  return 0;
}
```

d)
Next up is the `Player`. Because `playerTurn` and `dealerTurn` are very different from each other, we’ll keep them as non-member functions. Make `Player` a `class` and add a `drawCard` member function that deals the player one card from the deck, increasing the player’s score. We’ll also need a member function to access the `Player`‘s score. For convenience, add a member function named `isBust()` that returns `true` if the player’s score exceeds the maximum (`g_maximumScore`). 
The following code should compile:
```cpp
// ...

int main()
{
    Deck deck{};I can do before 3:30 Monday and any time Tuesday
￼
Message #general


    deck.shuffle();
    deck.print();

    Player player{};
    Player dealer{};

    int playerCard { player.drawCard(deck) };
    std::cout << "The player drew a card with value " << playerCard << " and now has score " << player.score() << '\n';

    int dealerCard { dealer.drawCard(deck) };
    std::cout << "The dealer drew a card with value " << dealerCard << " and now has score " << dealer.score() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

e) 
Why did we write the following statement like this:
```cpp
int playerCard { player.drawCard(deck) };
std::cout << "The player drew a card with value " << playerCard << " and now has score " << player.score() << '\n';
```
Instead of like this?
```cpp
std::cout << "The player drew a card with value " << player.drawCard(deck) << " and now has score " << player.score() << '\n';
```

f)
Almost there! Now, just fix up the remaining program to use the classes you wrote above. Since most of the functions have been moved into the classes, you can jettison them.
