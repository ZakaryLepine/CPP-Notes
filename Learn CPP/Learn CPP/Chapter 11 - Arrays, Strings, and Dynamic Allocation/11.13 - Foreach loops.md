**For-Each Loop (Range-Based For-Loop):** To iterate through every element in an array.

## For-each loops
```
for (element_declaration : array)
   statement;
```

*element_declaration* should have the same type as the array elements. Otherwise, type conversion occurs.

## For each loops and the auto keyword
Can let C++ deduce the type of the array elements.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr int fibonacci[]{ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 };
    for (auto number : fibonacci) // type is auto, so number has its type deduced from the fibonacci array
    {
       std::cout << number << ' ';
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## For each loops and references
```cpp
std::string array[]{ "peter", "likes", "frozen", "yogurt" };
for (const auto& element: array) // element is a const reference to the currently iterated array element. Prevents a copy from being made.
{
    std::cout << element << ' ';
}
```

## For each loops and non-arrays
For-each loops work with many kinds of list-like structures.

## For-each does not work with pointers to an array
To iterate through an array, for-each must know how big the array is.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sumArray(const int array[]) // array is a pointer
{
    int sum{ 0 };

    for (auto number : array) // compile error, the size of array isn't known
    {
        sum += number;
    }

    return sum;
}

int main()
{
     constexpr int array[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

     std::cout << sumArray(array) << '\n'; // array decays into a pointer here

     return 0;
}
```

## Get the index of the current element in for each loop
```
for (init-statement; element_declaration : array)
   statement;
``

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
    constexpr std::string_view names[]{ "Alex", "Betty", "Caroline", "Dave", "Emily" }; // Names of the students
    constexpr int scores[]{ 84, 92, 76, 81, 56 };
    int maxScore{ 0 };

    for (int i{ 0 }; auto score : scores) // i is the index of the current element
    {
        if (score > maxScore)
        {
            std::cout << names[i] << " beat the previous best score of " << maxScore << " by " << (score - maxScore) << " points!\n";
            maxScore = score;
        }

        ++i;
    }

    std::cout << "The best score was " << maxScore << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
Declare a fixed array with the following names: Alex, Betty, Caroline, Dave, Emily, Fred, Greg, and Holly. Ask the user to enter a name. Use a _for each_ loop to see if the name the user entered is in the array.

Sample output:
```
Enter a name: Betty
Betty was found.

Enter a name: Megatron
Megatron was not found.
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
int main()
{
	constexpr std::string_view names[] { "Alex", "Betty", "Caroline", "Dave", "Emily", "Fred", "Greg", "Holly"};

	std::cout << "Enter a name: ";
	std::string username {};
	std::cin >> username;

	bool found { false };

	for(std::string_view name : names)
	{
		if (name == username)
		{
			found = true;
			break;
		}
	}


	if (found)
        std::cout << username << " was found.\n";
    else
        std::cout << username << " was not found.\n";

	return 0;
}
```
