C++ already knows how to convert between built-in data types. 

C++ does not know how to convert any user-defined types.

**User-defined conversions** allows conversion of a class into another data type.

There are 3 things to note:
1. To overload the function that casts a class into another type, the conversion function is called *operator typeToCastTo()*. There is a space between the word *operator* and the type being casted to. Conversion functions must be non-static member functions.
2. User-defined conversions do not take parameters. There is no way to pass argument to the conversion functions.
3. User-defined conversions do not have a return type. C++ assumes that the correct type is being returned.
```cpp
class Cents
{
private:
    int m_cents;
public:
    Cents(int cents=0)
        : m_cents{ cents }
    {
    }

    // Overloaded int cast
    operator int() const { return m_cents; }

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
    void setCents(int cents) { m_cents = cents; }
};
```

The user-defined conversions work for implicit casts and explicit casts.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    Cents cents{ 7 };
    printInt(cents); // print 7
	printInt(static_cast<int>(cents));
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
#include <iostream>

class Cents
{
private:
    int m_cents;
public:
    Cents(int cents=0)
        : m_cents{ cents }
    {
    }

    // Overloaded int cast
    operator int() const { return m_cents; }

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
    void setCents(int cents) { m_cents = cents; }
};

class Dollars
{
private:
    int m_dollars;
public:
    Dollars(int dollars=0)
        : m_dollars{ dollars }
    {
    }

    // Allow us to convert Dollars into Cents
    operator Cents() const { return Cents { m_dollars * 100 }; }
};

void printCents(Cents cents)
{
    std::cout << cents; // cents will be implicitly cast to an int here
}

int main()
{
    Dollars dollars{ 9 };
    printCents(dollars); // dollars will be implicitly cast to a Cents here

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

## Converting constructors vs overloaded typecasts
Overloaded typecasts and converting constructors perform similar roles. 

An overloaded type casts allows defining a function that converts a program-defined type A into some other type B.

A converting constructor allows defininig a function that creates a program-defined type B from some other type A.

In general, a converting constructor is preferrable because converting constructors allows the type being constructed to own the construction.

An overloaded typecast is preferrable when:
- Providing a conversion to a fundamental type since constructors cannot be defined for these types.
- Providing a conversion to a type that members cannot be added to (e.g.: conversion to std::vector).
- The type being constructed should not be aware of the type being converted from.
