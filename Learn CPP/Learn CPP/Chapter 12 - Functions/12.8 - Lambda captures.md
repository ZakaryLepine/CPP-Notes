## Capture clauses and capture by value
Lambdas can only access specific kinds of identifiers that were not defined within their block scope.

The identifiers that a lambda can access are:
- Global identifiers.
- Entities that are known at compile time.
- Entities with static storage duration.

## The capture clause
**Capture Clause:** Used to indirectly give a lambda access to variables available in the surrounding scope that the lambda would normally not have access to.

List the entities that the lambda needs access to within the capture clause.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <string>

int main()
{
  std::array<std::string_view, 4> arr{ "apple", "banana", "walnut", "lemon" };

  std::cout << "search for: ";

  std::string search{};
  std::cin >> search;

  // Capture @search                                vvvvvv
  auto found{ std::find_if(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [search](std::string_view str) {
    return (str.find(search) != std::string_view::npos);
  }) };

  if (found == arr.end())
  {
    std::cout << "Not found\n";
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "Found " << *found << '\n';
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## How do capture clauses work
When a lambda definition is executed, each variable that the lambda captures is cloned with an identical name inside the lambda. 

The cloned variables have the same name but may not have the same type as the original variables.

When the compiler encounters a lambda definition, a custom object definition is created for the lambda. Each captured variables becomes a data member of the lambda. At runtime, when the lambda definition is encountered, a lambda object is instatiated and the the lambda's members are initialized. 

## Capture default to const value
By default, variables are captured by *const* value.

The lambda cannot modify the values of the captured variables.

## Mutable capture by value
Use the *mutable* keyword to make all captured variables mutable.

The values of captured variables persist across multiple calls to a lambda.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  int ammo{ 10 };

  auto shoot{
    // Added mutable after the parameter list.
    [ammo]() mutable {
      // We're allowed to modify ammo now
      --ammo;

      std::cout << "Pew! " << ammo << " shot(s) left.\n";
    }
  };

  shoot(); //9
  shoot(); //8

  std::cout << ammo << " shot(s) left\n"; //10

  return 0;
}
```



## Capture by reference
Variables that are captured by reference are non-const unless the captured variable was originally *const*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  int ammo{ 10 };

  auto shoot{
    // We don't need mutable anymore
    [&ammo]() { // &ammo means ammo is captured by reference
      // Changes to ammo will affect main's ammo
      --ammo;

      std::cout << "Pew! " << ammo << " shot(s) left.\n"; 
    }
  };

  shoot(); //9

  std::cout << ammo << " shot(s) left\n"; //9 

  return 0;
}
```

## Capturing multiple variables
Multiple variables can be captured by separating the variables with a comma.

```cpp
int health{ 33 };
int armor{ 100 };
std::vector<CEnemy> enemies{};

// Capture health and armor by value, and enemies by reference.
[health, armor, &enemies](){};
```

## Default captures
**Default Capture (Capture-Default):** Captures all variables that are mentioned in the lambda. Variables not mentioned are not captured.

Use *=* to capture all used variables by value.
Use *&* to capture all used variables by reference.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::array areas{ 100, 25, 121, 40, 56 };

  int width{};
  int height{};

  std::cout << "Enter width and height: ";
  std::cin >> width >> height;

  auto found{ std::find_if(areas.begin(), areas.end(),
                           [=](int knownArea) { // will default capture width and height by value
                             return (width * height == knownArea); // because they're mentioned here
                           }) };

  if (found == areas.end())
  {
    std::cout << "I don't know this area :(\n";
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "Area found :)\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Default captures can be mixed with normal captures. Each variable can only be captured once.
```cpp
int health{ 33 };
int armor{ 100 };
std::vector<CEnemy> enemies{};

// Capture health and armor by value, and enemies by reference.
[health, armor, &enemies](){};

// Capture enemies by reference and everything else by value.
[=, &enemies](){};

// Capture armor by value and everything else by reference.
[&, armor](){};

// Illegal, we already said we want to capture everything by reference.
[&, &armor](){};

// Illegal, we already said we want to capture everything by value.
[=, armor](){};

// Illegal, armor appears twice.
[armor, &health, &armor](){};

// Illegal, the default capture has to be the first element in the capture group.
[armor, &](){};
```

## Defining new variables in the lambda capture
Can define a new variables by defining the variable in the lambda capture without specifying a type.

```cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
  std::array areas{ 100, 25, 121, 40, 56 };

  int width{};
  int height{};

  std::cout << "Enter width and height: ";
  std::cin >> width >> height;

  // We store areas, but the user entered width and height.
  // We need to calculate the area before we can search for it.
  auto found{ std::find_if(areas.begin(), areas.end(),
                           // Declare a new variable that's visible only to the lambda.
                           // The type of userArea is automatically deduced to int.
                           [userArea{ width * height }](int knownArea) {
                             return (userArea == knownArea);
                           }) };

  if (found == areas.end())
  {
    std::cout << "I don't know this area :(\n";
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "Area found :)\n";
  }

  return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Only initialize variables in the capture if their value is short and their type is obvious. Otherwise it’s best to define the variable outside of the lambda and capture it.

## Dangling captured variables
Variables are captured at the point where the lambda is defined. 

If a variable captured by references dies be fore the lambda, the lambda will hold a dangling reference.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// returns a lambda
auto makeWalrus(const std::string& name)
{
  // Capture name by reference and return the lambda.
  return [&]() {
    std::cout << "I am a walrus, my name is " << name << '\n'; // Undefined behavior
  };
}

int main()
{
  // Create a new walrus whose name is Roofus.
  // sayName is the lambda returned by makeWalrus.
  auto sayName{ makeWalrus("Roofus") };

  // Call the lambda function that makeWalrus returned.
  sayName();

  return 0;
}
```

## Unintended copies of mutable lambdas
Lambdas can be copied because they are objects.

Copied lambdas are copied in their current state. If a captured variable is incremented before the copy, the incremented variable will still be incremented in the copy.

Use *std::reference_wrapper* to pass normal types as if the type is a reference type.

By wrapping the lambda with a *std::reference_wrapper*, anything attempting to make a copy of the lambda will make a copy of the reference instead.

### Question 3
#### Question
We’re going to write a little game with square numbers (numbers which can be created by multiplying an integer with itself (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …)).

Ask the user to input 2 numbers, the first is the square root of the number to start at, the second is the amount of numbers to generate. Generate a random integer from 2 to 4, and square numbers in the range that was chosen by the user. Multiply each square number by the random number. You can assume that the user enters valid numbers.

The user has to calculate which numbers have been generated. The program checks if the user guessed correctly and removes the guessed number from the list. If the user guessed wrong, the game is over and the program prints the number that was closest to the user’s final guess, but only if the final guess was not off by more than 4.

Here are a couple of sample sessions to give you a better understanding of how the game works:
```cpp
Start where? 4
How many? 8
I generated 8 square numbers. Do you know what each number is after multiplying it by 2?
> 32
Nice! 7 number(s) left.
> 72
Nice! 6 number(s) left.
> 50
Nice! 5 number(s) left.
> 126
126 is wrong! Try 128 next time.
```
-   The user chose to start at 4 and wants to play with 8 numbers.
-   Each square number will be multiplied by 2. 2 was randomly chosen by the program.
-   The program generates 8 square numbers, starting with 4 as a base:
-   16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
-   But each number is multiplied by 2, so we get:
-   32 50 72 98 128 162 200 242
-   Now the user starts to guess. The order in which the guesses are entered doesn’t matter.
-   32 is in the list.
-   72 is in the list.
-   126 is not in the list, the user loses. There is a number in the list (128) that is not more then 4 away from the user’s guess, so that number is printed.
```cpp
Start where? 1
How many? 3
I generated 3 square numbers. Do you know what each number is after multiplying it by 4?
> 4
Nice! 2 numbers left.
> 16
Nice! 1 numbers left.
> 36
Nice! You found all numbers, good job!
```
-   The user chose to start at 1 and wants to play with 3 numbers.
-   Each square number will be multiplied by 4.
-   The program generates these square numbers:
-   1 4 9
-   Multiplied by 4
-   4 16 36
-   The user guesses all numbers correctly and wins the game.
```
Start where? 2
How many? 2
I generated 2 square numbers. Do you know what each number is after multiplying it by 4?
> 21
21 is wrong!
```
-   The user chose to start at 2 and wants to play with 2 numbers.
-   Each square number will be multiplied by 4.
-   The program generates these numbers:
-   16 36
-   The user guesses 21 and loses. 21 is not close enough to any of the remaining numbers, so no number is printed.
Use `std::find` to search for a number in the list.  
Use `std::vector::erase` to remove an element, e.g.
```cpp
auto found{ std::find(/* ... */) };

// Make sure the element was found

myVector.erase(found);
```
Use `std::min_element` and a lambda to find the number closest to the user’s guess. `std::min_element` works analogous to `std::max_element` from the previous quiz.
