C++ does not have a single attribute that defines a variables as being local. Local variables have several peroperties that differentiate how local variables behave from other kinds of (non-local) variables. 


## Local variables have block scope
Local variables are in scope from their point of definition to the end of the block they are defined within.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i { 5 }; // i enters scope here
    double d { 4.0 }; // d enters scope here

    return 0;
} // d and i go out of scope here
```

## All variable names within a scope must be unique
```cpp
int main()
{
    int i { 5 }; // i enters scope here
    double d { 4.0 }; // d enters scope here

    return 0;
} // d and i go out of scope here
```

## Local variables have automatic storage duration
**Storage Duration:** Determines what rules govern when and how a variable will be created and destroyed. In most cases, a variable's duration directly determines its *lifetime*.
**Automatic Storage Duration:** Created at the point of definition and destoryed at the end of the block defined in.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i { 5 }; // i created and initialized here
    double d { 4.0 }; // d created and initialized here

    return 0;
} // d and i are destroyed here
```

## Local variables in nested blocks
Behave identically the same as local variables in function body blocks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{ // outer block

    int x { 5 }; // x enters scope and is created here

    { // nested block
        int y { 7 }; // y enters scope and is created here

        // x and y are both in scope here
        std::cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << x + y << '\n';
    } // y goes out of scope and is destroyed here

    // y can not be used here because it is out of scope in this block

    return 0;
} // x goes out of scope and is destroyed here
```

## Local variables have no linkage
**Linkage:** Determine whether other declarations of that name refers to the same object or not. 

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x { 2 }; // local variable, no linkage

    {
        int x { 3 }; // this identifier x refers to a different object than the previous x
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Scope defines where a single declaration can be seed and used. Linkage defines whether multiple declarations refer to the same object.

## Variables should be defined in the most limited scope
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // do not define y here

    {
        // y is only used inside this block, so define it here
        int y { 5 };
        std::cout << y << '\n';
    }

    // otherwise y could still be used here, where it's not needed

    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Define variables in the most limited existing scope. Avoid creating new blocks whose only purpose is to limit the scope of variables.

## Quiz
### Question 1
#### Question
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, one named `smaller`, the other named `larger`. If the user enters a smaller value for the second integer, use a block and a temporary variable to swap the smaller and larger values. Then print the values of the `smaller` and `larger` variables. Add comments to your code indicating where each variable dies. Note: When you print the values, `smaller` should hold the smaller input and `larger` the larger input, no matter which order they were entered in.

The program output should match the following:
```
Enter an integer: 4
Enter a larger integer: 2
Swapping the values
The smaller value is 2
The larger value is 4
```

#### Answer
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int smaller{};
    std::cin >> smaller;

    std::cout << "Enter a larger integer: ";
    int larger{};
    std::cin >> larger;

    // if user did it wrong
    if (smaller > larger)
    {
        // swap values of smaller and larger
        std::cout << "Swapping the values\n";

        int temp{ larger };
        larger = smaller;
        smaller = temp;
    } // temp dies here

    std::cout << "The smaller value is: " << smaller << '\n';
    std::cout << "The larger value is: " << larger << '\n';

    return 0;
} // smaller and larger die here
```

### Question 2
#### Question
What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and lifetime? By default, what kind of scope and duration do local variables have (and what do those mean)?
#### Answer
A variable’s scope determines where the variable is accessible. Duration defines the rules that govern when a variable is created and destroyed. A variable’s lifetime is the actual time between its creation and destruction.

Local variables have block scope which means that they can be accessed from their definition to the end of the block they are defined within.

Local variables have automatic duration which means that they are created at the point of definition and destroyed at the end of the block they are defined within.
