## Qualified and unqualified names
**Qualified Name:** Name that includes an associated scope. 
Names can be qualified with a namespace using the scope resolution operator.
```cpp
std::cout // identifier cout is qualified by namespace std
::foo // identifier foo is qualified by the global namespace
```

Name can be qualified by a class name using the scope resolution operator.
```cpp
class C;
C::s_member; // s_member is qualified by class C
```

Name can be qualified by a class object using the member selection operators (. or ->).
```cpp
obj.x; // x is qualified by class object obj
ptr->y; // y is qualified by pointer to class object ptr
```

**Unqualified Name:** Name that does not include a scoping qualifier. 

## Using declarations
**Using Declaration:** Statement that allows unqualified name as an alias for a qualified name.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   using std::cout; // this using declaration tells the compiler that cout should resolve to std::cout
   cout << "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here!

   return 0;
} // the using declaration expires here
```

A separate *using declaration* must be used for each name.

## Using directives
**Using Directive:** Imports all the identifiers from a namespace into the scope of the *using directive*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   using namespace std; // this using directive tells the compiler to import all names from namespace std into the current namespace without qualification
   cout << "Hello world!\n"; // so no std:: prefix is needed here
   return 0;
}
```

## Problems with using directives
Since *using directives* import all the names from a namespace, the possibility of a naming collision is greatly increased.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

namespace a
{
	int x{ 10 };
}

namespace b
{
	int x{ 20 };
}

int main()
{
	using namespace a;
	using namespace b;

	std::cout << x << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream> // imports the declaration of std::cout

int cout() // declares our own "cout" function
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    using namespace std; // makes std::cout accessible as "cout"
    cout << "Hello, world!\n"; // uh oh!  Which cout do we want here?  The one in the std namespace or the one we defined above?

    return 0;
}
```

The lack of explicit scope prefixes makes understanding what functions are part of a library and which are part of the program difficult.

```cpp
using namespace ns;

int main()
{
    foo(); // is this foo a user-defined function, or part of the ns library?
}
```

## The scope of using declarations and directives
When used within a block, *using declarations* and *using directives* are only applicable to the block.
When used in the global namespace, *using declarations* and *using directives* apply to the rest of the file. 

## Cancelling or replacing a using statement
```cpp
int main()
{
    using namespace foo;

    // there's no way to cancel the "using namespace foo" here!
    // there's also no way to replace "using namespace foo" with a different using statement

    return 0;
} // using namespace foo ends here
```

```
int main()
{
    {
        using namespace foo;
        // calls to foo:: stuff here
    } // using namespace foo expires

    {
        using namespace Goo;
        // calls to Goo:: stuff here
    } // using namespace Goo expires

    return 0;
}
```
