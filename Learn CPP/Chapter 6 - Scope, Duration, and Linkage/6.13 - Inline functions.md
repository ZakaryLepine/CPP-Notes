## Inline expansion
**Inline expansion:** Process where a function call is replaced by the code from the called function's definition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int min(int x, int y)
{
    return (x < y) ? x : y;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << min(5, 6) << '\n';
    std::cout << min(3, 2) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << ((5 < 6) ? 5 : 6) << '\n';
    std::cout << ((3 < 2) ? 3 : 2) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

## When inline expansion occurs
Every call to a function either:
- Must be expanded.
- May be expanded.
- Cannot be expanded.
**Inline Function:** A function that is eligible to have its function calls expanded.

# The inline keyword historically
Compilers were not able, or were not very good, at determining when inline expansion should occur.
The *inline* keyword was created to hint to the compiler that a function would benefit from being expanded inline.

## The inline keyword modernly
The *inline* keyword mean that multiple definitions are allowed in the program.
