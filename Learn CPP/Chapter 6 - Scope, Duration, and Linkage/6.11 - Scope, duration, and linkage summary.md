## Scope summary
An identifier's *scope* determines where the identifier can be accessed within the source code.

Variables with block (local) scope can only be accessed within the block in which they are declared in (also accessible in nested blocks):
- Local variables.
- Function parameters.
- User-defined type definitions declared inside a block

Variables with file (global) scope can be accessed from the point of declaration until the end of the file:
- Global variables.
- Functions.
- User-defined types declared inside a namespace or global scope.

## Duration summary
A variable's *duration* determine when the variable is created and destroyed.

Variables with *automatic duration* are created at the point of definition and destroyed when the block they are part of is exited:
- Local variables.
- Function parameters.

Variables with *static duration* are created when the program begins and destroyed when the program ends:
- Global variables.
- Static local variables.

Variables with *dynamic duration* are created and destroyed by user request:
- Dynamically allocated variables.

## Linkage summary

An identifier's *linkage* determines whether multiple declarations of an identifier refers to the same entity.

An identifier with *no linkage* means the identifiers only refers to itself:
- Local variables.
- User-defined type definitions declared in a block.

An identifier with *internal linkage* can be accessed anywhere within the file it is declared:
- Static global variables (initialized or uninitialized).
- Static functions
- Const global variables
- Functions declared inside an unnamed namespace.
- User-defined type definitions declared inside an unnamed namespace.

An identifier with *external linkage* can be accessed anywhere within the file it is declared or other files (via a forward declaration):
- Functions.
- Non-const global variables (initialized or uninitialized).
- Extern const global variables
- Inline const global variables
- User-defined type definitions declared inside a namespace or in the global scope

## What is a storage class specifier
**Storage Class Specifiers:** Set the storage duration and linkage of an identifier
| Specifier    | Meaning                                                              | Note                |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| extern       | static (or thread_local) storage duration and external linkage       |                     |
| static       | static (or thread_local) storage duration and internal linkage       |                     |
| thread_local | thread storage duration                                              |                     |
| mutable      | object allowed to be modified even if containing class is const      |                     |
| auto         | automatic storage duration                                           | Deprecated in C++11 |
| register     | automatic storage duration and hint to compiler to place in register | Deprecated in C++17 |
