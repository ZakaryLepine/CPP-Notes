**External Linkage:** Identifier that can be seen and used both from the file in which it is defined and from other code files (via a foward declaration).

## Functions have external linkage by default
In order to call a function defined in another file, a forward declaration for the function must be placed in every other code file that wants to call the function.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void sayHi() // this function has external linkage, and can be seen by other files
{
    std::cout << "Hi!\n";
}
```

```cpp
void sayHi(); // forward declaration for function sayHi, makes sayHi accessible in this file

int main()
{
    sayHi(); // call to function defined in another file, linker will connect this call to the function definition

    return 0;
}
```

## Global variables with external linkage
The *extern* keyword is used to make a a global variable external.

```cpp
int g_x { 2 }; // non-constant globals are external by default

extern const int g_y { 3 }; // const globals can be defined as extern, making them external
extern constexpr int g_z { 3 }; // constexpr globals can be defined as extern, making them external (but this is useless, see the note in the next section)

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

## Variable forward declarations via the extern keyword
To use an external global variable in another code file, a forward declaration of the global variable must be placed.
The *extern* keyword is used  to forward declare a global variable.

```cpp
// global variable definitions
int g_x { 2 }; // non-constant globals have external linkage by default
extern const int g_y { 3 }; // this extern gives g_y external linkage. Note that it is initialized ({}).
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

extern int g_x; // this extern is a forward declaration of a variable named g_x that is defined somewhere else
extern const int g_y; // this extern is a forward declaration of a const variable named g_y that is defined somewhere else. Note that it is not initialized ({}).

int main()
{
    std::cout << g_x << '\n'; // prints 2

    return 0;
}
```

###### Warning
Do not use the extern keyword to define an uninitialized global variable. The compiler will think that a forward declaration of the variable is being done.

###### Warning
constexpr variables can be given external linkage via the *extern* keyword. However, constexpr variables cannot be forward declared because the compiler must know the value of constexpr variables at compile-time which the compiler cannot know if it was done in the other file. 

## File scope vs global scope
All global variables have file scope and the linkage property controls whether they can be used in other files.

```cpp
int g_x { 2 }; // external linkage by default
// g_x goes out of scope here
```

```cpp
extern int g_x; // forward declaration for g_x -- g_x can be used beyond this point in this file

int main()
{
    std::cout << g_x << '\n'; // should print 2

    return 0;
}
// the forward declaration for g_x goes out of scope here
```

Informally, file scope is used to describe global variables with internal linkage while global scope is used to describe global variables with external linkage.

## Quick summary
```cpp
// External global variable definitions:
int g_x;                       // defines non-initialized external global variable (zero initialized by default)
extern const int g_x{ 1 };     // defines initialized const external global variable
extern constexpr int g_x{ 2 }; // defines initialized constexpr external global variable

// Forward declarations
extern int g_y;                // forward declaration for non-constant global variable
extern const int g_y;          // forward declaration for const global variable
extern constexpr int g_y;      // not allowed: constexpr variables can't be forward declared
```

## Quiz
### Question 1
#### Question
What’s the difference between a variable’s scope, duration, and linkage? What kind of scope, duration, and linkage do global variables have?

#### Answer
Scope refers to when a variable can be accessed. Duration refers to the rules that govern when a variable is created and destroyed. Linkage refers to whether an identifier can be exported to other files.

Global variables have global scope (file scope) which means they can be accessed from their point of declaration to the end of the file they are declared within.

Global variables have stati duration which means that they are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program ends.

Global variables can have internal or external linkage by using the *static* or *extern* keywords.
