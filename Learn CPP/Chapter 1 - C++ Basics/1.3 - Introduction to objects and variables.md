## Data
**Data:** Any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.

Programs are collections of instructions that manipulate data to produce a desired result.

## Objects and variables
**Random Access Memory (RAM):** Memory available for programs to use. 
**Value:** A single piece of data that is stored in memory.

**Object:** Region of storage that has a value and other ascoiated properties. 

**Variable:** Named object.

**Identifier:** Name of an object. 

## Variable instantiation 

**Definition:** Kind of declaration statement that is used to create variables.
```cpp
int x; // define a variable named x, of type int
```

When the compiler sees a definition, the compiler makes a note that a variable is being  defined with a name and a type. From that point forward, when the compiler sees the identifier, the compiler will know that the same variable is being referenced.

**Instantiation:** Means that an object is created and assigned a memory address.

At runtime, the variable is instantiated. Variables must be instantiated before being used store values.

## Data types
**Data Type:** Tells the comiler what type of value to store in a variable.

The type of variables must be known at compile-time. The type cannot be changed without recompiling a program.
