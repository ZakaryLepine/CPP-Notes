## The address-of operator
**Address-Of Operator (&):** Returns the memory-address of its operand. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    return 0;
}
```

## The dereference operator (\*)
**Dereference Operator (\*):** Returns the value at a given memory address as an l-value.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    std::cout << *(&x) << '\n'; // print the value at the memory address of variable x (parentheses not required, but make it easier to read)

    return 0;
}
```

## Pointers
**Pointer:** Object that stores a memory address.
```cpp
int;  // a normal int
int&; // an lvalue reference to an int value

int*; // a pointer to an int value (holds the address of an integer value)
```
###### Best practice
When declaring pointer types, place the asterisks with the type name.

## Pointer initialization
**Wild Pointer:** Pointer that has not been initialized. A wild pointer holds a random garbage memory address. Derefencing a wild pointer leads to undefined behavior. 

Pointers are not initialized by default.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };

    int* ptr;        // an uninitialized pointer (holds a garbage address)
    int* ptr2{};     // a null pointer (we'll discuss these in the next lesson)
    int* ptr3{ &x }; // a pointer initialized with the address of variable x

    return 0;
}
```

## Pointers and assignments
To change what the pointer is pointing at, assign a new address to the pointer.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // ptr initialized to point at x

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address being pointed to (x's address)

    int y{ 6 };
    ptr = &y; // // change ptr to point at y

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address being pointed to (y's address)

    return 0;
}
```
To change the value being pointed at, assging a new value to the dereferenced pointer.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // initialize ptr with address of variable x

    std::cout << x << '\n';    // print x's value
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address that ptr is holding (x's address)

    *ptr = 6; // The object at the address held by ptr (x) assigned value 6 (note that ptr is dereferenced here)

    std::cout << x << '\n';
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address that ptr is holding (x's address)

    return 0;
}
```

## Pointers behave much like lvalue references
Pointer and l-value references provide a way to indirectly access another object.

Differences between pointers and l-value references"
- References must be initialized. Pointer do not need to be initialized.
- References are not objects. Pointers are objects.
- References cannot be reseated. Pointers can be reseated.
- References must always be bound to an object. Pointers can be bound to nothing.
- References are safe. Pointers are inherently dangerous.

## The address-of operator returns a pointer
The address-of operator returns a pointer containing the address of the operand, whose type is derived from the argument

## The size of pointers
The size of pointers depends on the system's architecture.

The size of a pointer, on the same architecture, is always the same.

## Dangling pointers
**Dangling Pointer:** Pointer that holds the address of an object that has been destroyed.

### Question 1
#### Question
What values does this program print? Assume a short is 2 bytes, and a 32-bit machine.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	short value{ 7 }; // &value = 0012FF60
	short otherValue{ 3 }; // &otherValue = 0012FF54

	short* ptr{ &value };

	std::cout << &value << '\n';
	std::cout << value << '\n';
	std::cout << ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << *ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << '\n';

	*ptr = 9;

	std::cout << &value << '\n';
	std::cout << value << '\n';
	std::cout << ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << *ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << '\n';

	ptr = &otherValue;

	std::cout << &otherValue << '\n';
	std::cout << otherValue << '\n';
	std::cout << ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << *ptr << '\n';
	std::cout << '\n';

	std::cout << sizeof(ptr) << '\n';
	std::cout << sizeof(*ptr) << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

### Question 2
#### Question
Whatâ€™s wrong with this snippet of code?
```cpp
int value{ 45 };
int* ptr{ &value }; // declare a pointer and initialize with address of value
*ptr = &value; // assign address of value to ptr
```
#### Answer
A int value cannot be assigned a pointer to an integer.
