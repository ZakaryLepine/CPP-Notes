## Pointer to const value
**Pointer to a const value:** Non-const pointer that points to a constant value.

Use the *const* keyword before the pointer's data type.
```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x{ 5 };
    const int* ptr { &x }; // okay: ptr is pointing to a "const int"

    *ptr = 6; // not allowed: we can't change a const value

    return 0;
}
```
A pointer to a const value cannot change the value of the object being pointed to.

A pointer to a const value can change the address the pointer points to.

A pointer to const can point to non-const variables. The pointer treats the non-const value being pointed at  as const.

## Const pointer
**Const Pointer:** Pointer whose address cannot be changed after initialization.

Use the *const* keyword after the asterisk in the pointer declaration.
```cpp
int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* const ptr { &x }; // const after the asterisk means this is a const pointer

    return 0;
}
```

A const pointer must be initialized upon definition.

A const pointer can change the value of the object being pointed to.

## Const pointer to a const value
**Const Pointer to a Const Value:** Pointer that can not have its address changed, nor can the value it is pointing to be changed through the pointer. It can only be dereferenced to get the value it is pointing at.

Use the *const* keyword both before the type and after the asterisk.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int value { 5 };
    const int* const ptr { &value }; // a const pointer to a const value

    return 0;
}
```
