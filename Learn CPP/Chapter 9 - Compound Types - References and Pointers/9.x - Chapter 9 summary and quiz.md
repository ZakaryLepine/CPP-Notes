## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
For each of the following expressions on the right side of operator <<, indicate whether the expression is an lvalue or rvalue:
a)
`cpp std::cout << 5;

b)
```cpp
int x { 5 };
std::cout << x;
```
c)
```cpp
int x { 5 };
std::cout << x + 1;
```

d) 
```cpp
int foo() { return 5; }
std::cout << foo();
```

e)
```cpp
int& max(int &x, int &y) { return x > y ? x : y; }
int x { 5 };
int y { 6 };
std::cout << max(x, y);
```
#### Answer
1a) R-value. LIterals are r-values.
1b) L-value.
1c) R-value
1d) R-value
1e) L-value
### Question 2
#### Question
What is the output of this program?
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int x{ 5 };
	int y{ 6 };

	int& ref{ x };
	++ref;
	ref = y;
	++ref;

	std::cout << x << ' ' << y;

	return 0;
}
```
#### Answer
7 6 
### Question 3
#### Question
Name two reasons why we prefer to pass arguments by const reference instead of by non-const reference whenever possible.
#### Answer
1. Arguments by const reference can be modifiable l-values, nonmodifiable l-values, and r-values (temporary object is created).
2. Arguments by const reference cannot have their underlying object modified.
### Question 4
#### Question
What is the difference between a const pointer and a pointer-to-const?
#### Answer
A const pointer is a pointer whose address cannot be reseated.
A pointer to const is a pointer to a const object. The object's value cannot be changed but the pointer can be reseated.
