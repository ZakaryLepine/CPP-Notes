## L-value references to const
```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x { 5 };    // x is a non-modifiable lvalue
    const int& ref { x }; // okay: ref is a an lvalue reference to a const value

    return 0;
}
```

L-value references to const can be used to access the underlying object but not modify it.

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x { 5 };    // x is a non-modifiable lvalue
    const int& ref { x }; // okay: ref is a an lvalue reference to a const value

    return 0;
}
```

## Initializing an l-value reference to const with a modifiable l-value
L-value references to const can also bind to a modifiable l-value.

The object being reference is treated as *const*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };          // x is a modifiable lvalue
    const int& ref { x }; // okay: we can bind a const reference to a modifiable lvalue

    std::cout << ref << '\n'; // okay: we can access the object through our const reference
    ref = 7;                 // error: we can not modify an object through a const reference

    x = 6;                // okay: x is a modifiable lvalue, we can still modify it through the original identifier

    return 0;
}
```

###### Best practice
Favor l-value reference to const over l-value reference to non-const unless the underlying object needs to be modifiable.

## Initializing an lvalue reference to const with an rvalue
L-value references to const can be initialized with an r-value.

A temporary object is created and initialized with the r-value, and the reference to const is bound to the temporary object.

## Const references bound to temporary objects extend the lifetime of the temporary object

Temporary objects are normally destroyed at the end of the expression in which they are created.

When a const lvalue reference is bound to a temporary object, the lifetime of the temporary object is extended to match the lifetime of the reference.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const int& ref { 5 }; // The temporary object holding value 5 has its lifetime extended to match ref

    std::cout << ref << '\n'; // Therefore, we can safely use it here

    return 0;
} // Both ref and the temporary object die here
```
