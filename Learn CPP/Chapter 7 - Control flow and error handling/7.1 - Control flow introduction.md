| Conditional statements | Cause a sequence of code to execute when a condition is met                                                   | if, switch                       |
| Jumps                  | Tells the CPU to execute the statements at another location                                                   | goto, break, continue            |
| Function calls         | Jumps to some location and back                                                                               | Function calls, return           |
| Loops                  | Tells the program to repeatedly execute some sequence of code zero or more times until a condition is not met | While, do-while, for, ranged-for |
| [Halts](7.11%20-%20Halts.md)                  | Tells the program to quit running                                                                             | std::exit(), std::abort()        |
| Exceptions             | Special kind of flow control structure designed for error handling                                            | Try, throw, catch                |
