## Shallow copying
The default copy constructor and default copy assignment operator provide shallow copying using memberwise copy. Each member of the class is individually copied.

When designing classes that handle dynamically allocated memory, memberwise copying does not work because member copying only copies the address stored by a pointer (new object points to the same memory).

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    MyString hello{ "Hello, world!" };
    {
        MyString copy{ hello }; // use default copy constructor
    } // copy is a local variable, so it gets destroyed here.  The destructor deletes copy's string, which leaves hello with a dangling pointer

    std::cout << hello.getString() << '\n'; // this will have undefined behavior

    return 0;
}
```

## Deep copying
A **deep copy** allocates memory for the copy and then copies the actual value so that the copy lives in distinct memory from its source.

The copy and source are distinct and do not affect each other in any way.

Deep copying requires creating custom copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators.

```cpp
// assumes m_data is initialized
void MyString::deepCopy(const MyString& source)
{
    // first we need to deallocate any value that this string is holding!
    delete[] m_data;

    // because m_length is not a pointer, we can shallow copy it
    m_length = source.m_length;

    // m_data is a pointer, so we need to deep copy it if it is non-null
    if (source.m_data)
    {
        // allocate memory for our copy
        m_data = new char[m_length];

        // do the copy
        for (int i{ 0 }; i < m_length; ++i)
            m_data[i] = source.m_data[i];
    }
    else
        m_data = nullptr;
}

// Copy constructor
MyString::MyString(const MyString& source)
{
    deepCopy(source);
}
```

```cpp
// Assignment operator
MyString& MyString::operator=(const MyString& source)
{
    // check for self-assignment
    if (this != &source)
    {
        // now do the deep copy
        deepCopy(source);
    }

    return *this;
}
```

## Summary
- The default copy constructor and default copy assignment operators do shallow copies.
- Classes with dynamically allocated variables need to have a copy constructor and assignment operator that do a deep copy.
- Favor using classes in the standard library over doing custom memory management.
