## Overloading operator\[]
The subscript operator must be overloaded as a member function.

The parameter of the overloaded operator\[] function is the subscript.
```cpp
class IntList
{
private:
    int m_list[10]{};

public:
    int& operator[] (int index);
};

int& IntList::operator[] (int index)
{
    return m_list[index];
}
```

## Why operator\[] returns a reference
Any value of the left-hand side of an assignment must be an l-value.

Since the return value of operator\[] can be used on the left0hand side of an assignment, the return value must be an l-value.

References are always l-values because a reference can only be bound to variables that have memory addresses.

## Dealing with const objects
Can define a non-const and const version of operator\[] separately. 

The non-const version is used for non-const objects and the const version is used for const objects.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class IntList
{
private:
    int m_list[10]{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }; // give this class some initial state for this example

public:
    int& operator[] (int index);
    int operator[] (int index) const; // could also return const int& if returning a non-fundamental type
};

int& IntList::operator[] (int index) // for non-const objects: can be used for assignment
{
    return m_list[index];
}

int IntList::operator[] (int index) const // for const objects: can only be used for access
{
    return m_list[index];
}

int main()
{
    IntList list{};
    list[2] = 3; // okay: calls non-const version of operator[]
    std::cout << list[2] << '\n';

    const IntList clist{};
    clist[2] = 3; // compile error: calls const version of operator[], which returns by value.  Cannot assign to this because it is an rvalue.
    std::cout << clist[2] << '\n';

   return 0;
}
```

## Pointers to objects and overloaded operator\[] don’t mix
When calling operator\[] on a pointer to an object, C++ assumes that the user is attempting to index an array of objects.

```cpp
#include <cassert> // for assert()
#include <iterator> // for std::size()

class IntList
{
private:
    int m_list[10]{};

public:
    int& operator[] (int index);
};

int& IntList::operator[] (int index)
{
    assert(index >= 0 && index < std::size(m_list));

    return m_list[index];
}

int main()
{
    IntList* list{ new IntList{} };
    list [2] = 3; // error: this will assume we're accessing index 2 of an array of IntLists
    delete list;

    return 0;
}
```

The proper syntax is to dereference the pointer then calll operator\[].
```cpp
int main()
{
    IntList* list{ new IntList{} };
    (*list)[2] = 3; // get our IntList object, then call overloaded operator[]
    delete list;

    return 0;
}
```

## The function parameter does not need to be an integer
Can overload the operator\[] to take a value of any type desired.

```cpp
int main()
{
    IntList* list{ new IntList{} };
    (*list)[2] = 3; // get our IntList object, then call overloaded operator[]
    delete list;

    return 0;
}
```

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
A map is a class that stores elements as a key-value pair. The key must be unique, and is used to access the associated pair. In this quiz, we’re going to write an application that lets us assign grades to students by name, using a simple map class. The student’s name will be the key, and the grade (as a char) will be the value.

a)
First, write a struct named `StudentGrade` that contains the student’s name (as a `std::string`) and grade (as a `char`).

b)
Add a class named `GradeMap` that contains a `std::vector` of `StudentGrade` named `m_map`.

c)
Write an overloaded `operator[]` for this class. This function should take a `std::string` parameter, and return a reference to a char. In the body of the function, first see if the student’s name already exists. If the student exists, return a reference to the grade and you’re done. Otherwise, use the `std::vector::push_back()` function to add a `StudentGrade` for this new student. When you do this, std::vector will add a copy of your StudentGrade to itself (resizing if needed, invalidating all previously returned references). Finally, we need to return a reference to the grade for the student we just added to the std::vector. We can access the student we just added using the std::vector::back() function.
The following program should run:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// ...

int main()
{
	GradeMap grades{};

	grades["Joe"] = 'A';
	grades["Frank"] = 'B';

	std::cout << "Joe has a grade of " << grades["Joe"] << '\n';
	std::cout << "Frank has a grade of " << grades["Frank"] << '\n';

	return 0;
}```

#### Answer
a)
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct StudentGrade
{
	std::string name {};
	char grade {};
};
```

b)
```cpp
#include <string>

struct StudentGrade
{
	std::string name {};
	char grade {};
};

class GradeMap
{
private:
	std::vector<StudentGrade> m_map {};
}
```

c)
```cpp
#include <string>

struct StudentGrade
{
	std::string name {};
	char grade {};
};

class GradeMap
{
private:
	std::vector<StudentGrade> m_map {};
public:
	char& operator[](std::string_view name);
	
}

char& GradeMap::operator[](std::string_view name)
{
	auto found {
		std::find_if(m_map.begin(), m_map.end(), 
		[&](const auto& student) {
			return (student.name = name);
		})
	};
	
	if (found != m_map.end())
	{
		return found -> grade;
	}

	//Otherwise create a new StudentGrade for the student and add to end of the vector
	m_map.push_back(StudentGrade { std::string name});

	return m_map.back().grade;l
}
```
