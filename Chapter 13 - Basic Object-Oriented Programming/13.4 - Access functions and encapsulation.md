## Encapsulation
**Encapsulation (Information Hiding)** is the process of keeping details about how an object is implemented hidden from users of the object. Users use the object through a public interface without needing to understand how the object is implemented.

Encapsulation is done via access specifiers. 

Member variables are made private. Most member functions are made public.

## Access functions
**Access functioins** are short public functions whose job is to retrieve or change the value of a private member variable.

```cpp
class Date
{
private:
    int m_month;
    int m_day;
    int m_year;

public:
    int getMonth() { return m_month; } // getter for month
    void setMonth(int month) { m_month = month; } // setter for month

    int getDay() { return m_day; } // getter for day
    void setDay(int day) { m_day = day; } // setter for day

    int getYear() { return m_year; } // getter for year
    void setYear(int year) { m_year = year; } // setter for year
};
```

###### Best practice 
Getters should return by value or const reference.
