```cpp
class Something
{
private:
    int m_value1 {};
    double m_value2 {};
    char m_value3 {};

public:
    Something()
    {
        // These are all assignments, not initializations
        m_value1 = 1;
        m_value2 = 2.2;
        m_value3 = 'c';
    }
};
```

When a class constructor is executed, the member variables are created. When the body of the constructors is ran, the member data variables are assigned values. 

However, some types of data must be initialized when they are declared. E.G.: const and reference variables.

```CPP
class Something
{
private:
    const int m_value;

public:
    Something()
    {
        m_value = 1; // error: const vars can not be assigned to
    }
};
```

## Member initializer lists
C++ provids a method for initializing class member variables (rather than assigning to them after they are created) via a **member initialization list**. 

Member initialization list replaces the need to do assignments in the constructor body.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Something
{
private:
    int m_value1 {};
    double m_value2 {};
    char m_value3 {};

public:
    Something() : m_value1{ 1 }, m_value2{ 2.2 }, m_value3{ 'c' } // Initialize our member variables
    {
    // No need for assignment here
    }

    void print()
    {
         std::cout << "Something(" << m_value1 << ", " << m_value2 << ", " << m_value3 << ")\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    Something something{};
    something.print();
    return 0;
}
```

Member initialization list supports provides default values.

###### Best practice
Use member initializer lists to initialize class members.

## Initializating const member variables
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Something
{
private:
	const int m_value;

public:
	Something(int x) : m_value{ x } // directly initialize our const member variable
	{
	}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << "Something(" << m_value << ")\n";
	}
};

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int x{};
	std::cin >> x;

	Something s{ x };
	s.print();

	return 0;
}
```

## Initializing array members with member initializer lists
```cpp
class Something
{
private:
    const int m_array[5];

public:
    Something(): m_array { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } // use uniform initialization to initialize our member array
    {
    }

};
```

## Initializing member variables that are classes
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A
{
public:
    A(int x = 0) { std::cout << "A " << x << '\n'; }
};

class B
{
private:
    A m_a {};
public:
    B(int y)
        : m_a{ y - 1 } // call A(int) constructor to initialize member m_a
    {
        std::cout << "B " << y << '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    B b{ 5 };
    return 0;
}
```

## Initializer list order
Variables in  the initializer list are initialized in the order which the members are declared in the class declaration.

The 2 following recommendations should be followed:
1. Ensure that member variables are properly initialized even if the initialization ordering is different.
2. Initialize variables in the same order in which they are declared in the class declaration.

## Quiz time
### Question 1
#### Question
Write a class named RGBA that contains 4 member variables of type std::uint8_t named m_red, m_green, m_blue, and m_alpha (#include cstdint to access type std::uint8_t). Assign default values of 0 to m_red, m_green, and m_blue, and 255 to m_alpha. Create a constructor that uses a member initializer list that allows the user to initialize values for m_red, m_blue, m_green, and m_alpha. Include a print() function that outputs the value of the member variables.

Hint: If your print() function isn’t working correctly, make sure you’re casting uint8_t to an int.

The following code should run:
```cpp

```
and produce the result:
```
r=0 g=127 b=127 a=255
```
#### Answer
```cpp
#include <cstdint> // for std::uint8_t
#include <iostream>

class RGBA
{
	std::uint8_t m_red {};
	std::uint8_t m_green {};
	std::uint8_t m_blue {};
	std::uint8_t m_alpha {};

	RGBA(std::uint8_t red = 0, std::uint8_t green = 0, std::uint8_t blue = 0, std::uint8_t alpha = 0)
		: m_red { red }, m_green { green }, m_blue { blue }, m_alpha { alpha }
		{
		}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << "r=" << static_cast<int>(m_red)
			<< " g=" << static_cast<int>(m_green)
			<< " b=" << static_cast<int>(m_blue)
			<< " a=" << static_cast<int>(m_alpha)
			<< '\n';
	}
};
```
